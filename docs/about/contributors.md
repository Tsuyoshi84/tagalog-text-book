# Contributors

## Project Maintainers

This project is maintained by individuals committed to creating high-quality educational resources for Tagalog learners. The maintainers oversee content quality, structural consistency, and adherence to the project guidelines.

## Contribution Guidelines

### Content Standards

Contributors are expected to follow the guidelines specified in the project documentation. All content must adhere to these standards:

- **Accuracy**: Grammar explanations and examples must be linguistically accurate and reflect standard Tagalog usage.
- **Clarity**: Content should be written in clear, accessible language appropriate for learners.
- **Consistency**: Formatting, terminology, and style must be consistent across all pages.
- **Completeness**: Pages should be fully developed without placeholder text or incomplete sections.

### Formatting Requirements

All contributions must follow the established formatting patterns:

- **Frontmatter**: Every page requires YAML frontmatter with title, description, and outline settings.
- **Headings**: Use level-1 heading after frontmatter, level-2 for main sections, level-3 for subsections.
- **Tagalog Text**: Italicize all Tagalog words and phrases using asterisks.
- **Translations**: Provide English translations for all Tagalog examples.
- **Tables**: Use markdown tables for structured comparisons and systematic information.
- **Tone**: Maintain a neutral, educational, third-person tone throughout.

### Content Organization

New content should fit logically within the existing site structure:

- Grammar topics belong in the `guide/` directory.
- Conversational phrases belong in the `phrases/` directory.
- Idiomatic expressions belong in the `expressions/` directory.
- Quick-reference materials belong in the `reference/` directory.
- Cultural information belongs in the `culture/` directory.

### Quality Checklist

Before submitting contributions, verify the following:

- Frontmatter is present and complete.
- Tagalog examples are italicized and translated.
- Tables are properly formatted and aligned.
- "See also" links are included where relevant.
- No placeholder text remains in the content.
- The page builds successfully without errors.

### Linguistic Accuracy

Contributors should have knowledge of Tagalog grammar and usage. Examples should reflect standard Tagalog as used in the Manila area, with notes on regional variations where appropriate.

When discussing grammatical concepts, use consistent terminology:

- **Focus** (not voice) for verbal focus system.
- **Aspect** for completed, ongoing, and contemplated forms.
- **Affix** for prefixes, infixes, and suffixes.

### Cultural Sensitivity

Content involving cultural topics should be respectful and accurate. Contributors should avoid stereotypes and present cultural information in a neutral, informative manner.

- **New Content**: Adding missing pages or expanding existing sections.
- **Error Corrections**: Fixing grammatical errors, typos, or inaccuracies.
