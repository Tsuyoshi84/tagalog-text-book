# About This Project

## Project Purpose

This website serves as a comprehensive educational resource for learning Tagalog grammar, vocabulary, and expressions. The project aims to provide clear, accurate, and well-organized grammar references that support learners at all levels.

The site focuses on three core areas:

- **Grammar foundations**: Detailed explanations of Tagalog grammar rules, verb systems, sentence structure, and parts of speech.
- **Practical usage**: Everyday phrases, idioms, and expressions organized by context for real-world communication.
- **Cultural context**: Cultural insights that help learners understand the social and historical aspects of the language.

## Target Audience

The materials are designed for:

- English speakers learning Tagalog as a second language.
- Learners seeking a structured, reference-style grammar guide.
- Anyone interested in understanding the linguistic features of Tagalog.

## Project Approach

The content follows a neutral, educational tone similar to a textbook. Every Tagalog example includes an English translation, and grammar concepts are presented systematically with clear examples and comparison tables.

The site prioritizes accuracy, clarity, and consistency across all pages. Content is organized hierarchically to support both linear learning and quick reference lookups.

## Technology Stack

The website is built using **VitePress**, a static site generator optimized for documentation. All content is written in **Markdown** for ease of maintenance and contribution.

## Content Organization

The site is organized into six main sections:

- **Guide**: Core grammar explanations covering pronunciation, sentence structure, verbs, nouns, adjectives, and more.
- **Phrases**: Practical phrases organized by everyday contexts such as greetings, travel, shopping, and emergencies.
- **Expressions**: Idioms, common expressions, emotional language, and Taglish usage.
- **Reference**: Quick-access materials including grammar cheat sheets, affix lists, and pronunciation guides.
- **Culture**: Cultural notes on etiquette, holidays, regional differences, and language history.
- **About**: Project information, site structure, contributors, and license details.

## Navigation

Each section contains an index page that summarizes its contents. Cross-references between related topics are provided through inline links to support comprehensive understanding.
