# Etiquette

Filipino culture emphasizes respect, harmony, and social propriety. These values directly influence language use, particularly in formal situations and interactions with elders or authority figures.

## Politeness Markers

### Po and Opo

The particles *po* and *opo* are fundamental politeness markers used when addressing elders, strangers, or people in positions of authority.

::: tip Usage
- *Po* is added to statements and questions
- *Opo* means "yes" (polite form of *oo*)
:::

**Examples:**

- *Salamat po.*  
  (Thank you, sir/ma'am.)

- *Kumain na po kayo?*  
  (Have you eaten already, sir/ma'am?)

- *Opo, nandito ako.*  
  (Yes, sir/ma'am, I am here.)

- *Paalam po.*  
  (Goodbye, sir/ma'am.)

### Mano Po

The *mano po* gesture is a traditional sign of respect where younger individuals take an elder's hand and press it to their forehead while saying *mano po*.

- *Mano po, Lola.*  
  (Blessing please, Grandmother.)

## Forms of Address

### Honorific Titles

Filipinos use specific titles to show respect based on age and relationship:

| Tagalog | English | Usage |
| ------- | ------- | ----- |
| *Kuya* | Older brother | For older males or male friends |
| *Ate* | Older sister | For older females or female friends |
| *Tito* / *Tiyo* | Uncle | For older male relatives or family friends |
| *Tita* / *Tiya* | Aunt | For older female relatives or family friends |
| *Lolo* | Grandfather | For grandfathers or elderly men |
| *Lola* | Grandmother | For grandmothers or elderly women |

**Examples:**

- *Kumusta po kayo, Tita Rosa?*  
  (How are you, Auntie Rosa?)

- *Kuya, tulungan mo ako.*  
  (Older brother, please help me.)

### Professional Titles

Professional titles are used with surnames or given names:

- *Sir* - Used for male teachers, bosses, or professionals
- *Ma'am* - Used for female teachers, bosses, or professionals
- *Doktor* - Doctor
- *Attorney* / *Abogado* - Lawyer

## Social Customs

### Greetings

Greetings often include pleasantries about meals and well-being:

- *Kumain ka na?*  
  (Have you eaten already?)

This is not necessarily an invitation to eat, but a way of showing concern for the other person's welfare.

### Indirect Communication

Filipinos often communicate indirectly to avoid confrontation or causing offense. This is connected to the concept of *hiya* (shame/embarrassment).

::: info Cultural Context
Direct refusals or criticisms may be softened or avoided entirely to maintain harmony (*pakikisama*).
:::

**Examples:**

- Instead of "No," one might say:  
  *Tingnan ko muna.* (Let me see first.)  
  *Siguro.* (Maybe.)

- Instead of direct criticism:  
  *Medyo mahirap lang.* (It's just a bit difficult.)

### Hospitality

Filipinos are known for exceptional hospitality:

- Visitors are offered food and drinks immediately
- Refusal may be met with insistence; polite acceptance is appreciated
- *Kain tayo* (Let's eat) is a common invitation

## Behavioral Expectations

### Respect for Elders

Elders receive priority in seating, serving food, and speaking order. Younger individuals:

- Give up seats for elders
- Serve elders first during meals
- Wait for elders to eat before starting
- Avoid contradicting elders directly

### Public Behavior

Social norms emphasize modesty and restraint:

- Public displays of affection are generally minimal
- Loud or boisterous behavior may be seen as improper
- Maintaining composure (*hiya*) is valued

### Gift Giving

When visiting homes, small gifts are appreciated:

- *Pasalubong* - gifts or treats brought when returning from travel
- Food items are common and well-received
- Gifts are typically not opened immediately in the giver's presence

## Language-Specific Etiquette

### Formal vs. Informal Speech

The choice between formal and informal language depends on:

- Age difference
- Social status
- Familiarity
- Context (professional, family, casual)

::: warning Important
Always use *po/opo* with strangers, elders, or authority figures until invited to speak more casually.
:::

### Asking for Favors

Requests are typically softened with polite phrases:

- *Puwede po bang...?*  
  (Could I please...?)

- *Makikiusap po ako.*  
  (I would like to ask a favor, please.)

- *Sana po ay maaari...*  
  (I hope it would be possible...)

### Apologizing

Apologies are important for maintaining relationships:

- *Pasensya na po.*  
  (I'm sorry/Excuse me, please.)

- *Patawad po.*  
  (Please forgive me.)

- *Humihingi ako ng paumanhin.*  
  (I apologize.)

## Common Expressions of Respect

| Tagalog | English | Context |
| ------- | ------- | ------- |
| *Salamat po* | Thank you, sir/ma'am | Showing gratitude politely |
| *Opo* | Yes, sir/ma'am | Polite affirmation |
| *Hindi po* | No, sir/ma'am | Polite negation |
| *Pwede po ba?* | May I, please? | Asking permission |
| *Excuse po* | Excuse me | Getting attention or passing through |

## Regional Variations

While these etiquette principles are generally consistent across the Philippines, specific expressions and customs may vary by region. Urban and rural areas may also differ in formality levels and traditional practices.
