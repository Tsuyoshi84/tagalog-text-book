# Language History

Tagalog has evolved over centuries through indigenous development, foreign colonization, trade, and cultural exchange. Understanding this history explains many features of modern Filipino, including its vocabulary, writing system, and grammatical structures.

## Pre-Colonial Period (Before 1521)

### Origins and Classification

Tagalog belongs to the Austronesian language family, specifically the Malayo-Polynesian branch, which includes:

- Malay
- Indonesian
- Javanese
- Hawaiian
- Maori

**Evidence suggests:**
- Austronesian peoples migrated to the Philippines around 4,000-5,000 years ago
- Early Tagalog developed in the Manila Bay region
- Trade with neighboring Southeast Asian peoples influenced vocabulary

### Early Writing System: Baybayin

Before Spanish colonization, Tagalog was written using *Baybayin*, an indigenous script.

**Characteristics:**

- Syllabic writing system (abugida)
- Written horizontally or vertically
- Consisted of 17 basic characters
- Each consonant had an inherent vowel sound
- Diacritical marks modified vowel sounds

**Example:**

The word *Baybayin* itself means "to spell" or "to write."

::: info Writing Materials
Ancient Filipinos wrote on bamboo, bark, and leaves using knives and plant-based ink.
