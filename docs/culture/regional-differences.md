# Regional Differences

The Philippines is linguistically and culturally diverse, with over 170 languages spoken across its 7,000+ islands. While Tagalog (or Filipino) serves as a national language, regional variations in vocabulary, pronunciation, and even grammar exist. Understanding these differences enhances communication and cultural awareness.

## Major Language Groups

### Tagalog-Speaking Regions

Tagalog is primarily spoken in:

- Metro Manila (National Capital Region)
- Central Luzon (except Pampanga and parts of Zambales)
- Southern Tagalog (CALABARZON and MIMAROPA)
- Parts of Mindoro and Palawan

::: info Standard Filipino
Modern Filipino, the standardized national language, is based on Tagalog but incorporates vocabulary from other Philippine languages and foreign influences.
