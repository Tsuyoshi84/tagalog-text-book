Many emotional expressions use reduplication or intensifiers like *sobra*, *talaga*, and *na* to emphasize feelings. Example: *Galit* (angry) becomes *Galit na galit* (very angry).
:::

::: info Cultural Context
Filipinos often express emotions indirectly or with softer language to maintain harmony. Direct expressions of anger or frustration may be softened with phrases like *Naku* or *Hay naku*.
