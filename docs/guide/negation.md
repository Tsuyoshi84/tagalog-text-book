### *Wala* / *Walang* (None/Nothing/Not Exist)

*Wala* expresses absence, non-existence, or lack of something. It's the negative of *may* (there is/are, have).

  (Is there anyone inside? - No one.)

::: info *Wala* vs. *Walang*

Use *wala* when followed by a pronoun or when standing alone: *Wala ako.* (I don't have any.) / *Wala siyang pera.* (He/She doesn't have money.)
:::
