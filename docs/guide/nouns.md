# Nouns in Tagalog

Nouns (*pangngalan*) in Tagalog name people, places, things, or concepts. Unlike English, Tagalog nouns do not inflect for number (singular/plural) or gender. Instead, plurality and grammatical relationships are indicated through markers, particles, and context.

## Types of Nouns

### Common Nouns

Common nouns refer to general categories of people, places, or things.

- *bahay* (house)
- *tao* (person)
- *libro* (book)
- *mesa* (table)
- *hayop* (animal)
- *paaralan* (school)

### Proper Nouns

Proper nouns name specific individuals, places, or entities and are typically capitalized.

- *Juan* (Juan)
- *Maria* (Maria)
- *Manila* (Manila)
- *Pilipinas* (Philippines)
- *Lunes* (Monday)
- *Enero* (January)

::: tip Proper Noun Markers
Proper nouns use specific markers: *si* (topic marker) and *ni* (non-topic marker) for personal names, *ang* for place names.
:::

### Abstract Nouns

Abstract nouns represent ideas, qualities, or states that cannot be physically touched.

- *pag-ibig* (love)
- *kalayaan* (freedom)
- *kaalaman* (knowledge)
- *kagandahan* (beauty)
- *katotohanan* (truth)
- *kaligayahan* (happiness)

### Collective Nouns

Collective nouns refer to groups of people or things.

- *pamilya* (family)
- *grupo* (group)
- *klase* (class)
- *bayan* (town/nation)
- *barkada* (group of friends)

## Case Markers

Tagalog uses case markers to indicate the grammatical function of nouns in sentences.

### Topic Markers (*Ang*-forms)

These mark the topic or focus of the sentence:

| Marker | Use | Example |
| ------ | --- | ------- |
| *ang* | Common noun (singular/plural, definite) | *ang bahay* (the house) |
| *ang mga* | Common noun (plural, definite) | *ang mga bata* (the children) |
| *si* | Personal name (singular) | *si Juan* (Juan) |
| *sina* | Personal names (plural) | *sina Juan at Maria* (Juan and Maria) |

Examples:

- *Maganda ang bahay.*  
  (The house is beautiful.)
- *Kumain si Maria.*  
  (Maria ate.)
- *Naglalaro ang mga bata.*  
  (The children are playing.)

### Non-Topic Markers (*Ng*-forms)

These mark non-topic nouns, including objects, possessors, and agents in non-actor focus:

| Marker | Use | Example |
| ------ | --- | ------- |
| *ng* | Common noun (singular/plural, indefinite) | *ng bahay* (of a house) |
| *ng mga* | Common noun (plural) | *ng mga libro* (of books) |
| *ni* | Personal name (singular) | *ni Juan* (of Juan) |
| *nina* | Personal names (plural) | *nina Juan at Maria* (of Juan and Maria) |

Examples:

- *Bumili ako ng libro.*  
  (I bought a book.)
- *Kinain ng bata ang tinapay.*  
  (The child ate the bread.)
- *Bahay ni Maria ito.*  
  (This is Maria's house.)

### Locative Markers (*Sa*-forms)

These mark location, direction, or indirect objects:

| Marker | Use | Example |
| ------ | --- | ------- |
| *sa* | Common noun (location/direction) | *sa bahay* (at/to the house) |
| *sa mga* | Common noun (plural location) | *sa mga bata* (to the children) |
| *kay* | Personal name (singular) | *kay Juan* (at/to Juan) |
| *kina* | Personal names (plural) | *kina Juan at Maria* (at/to Juan and Maria) |

Examples:

- *Pumunta ako sa tindahan.*  
  (I went to the store.)
- *Nasa bahay si Juan.*  
  (Juan is at home.)
- *Ibigay mo kay Maria.*  
  (Give it to Maria.)

::: info Marker Pronunciation
*Ng* is pronounced "nang" (like "ng" in "sing"). It is a single consonant sound, not two separate letters.
:::

## Plurality

Tagalog does not inflect nouns for number. Plurality is indicated by:

### Using *Mga*

The particle *mga* (pronounced "manga") indicates plurality:

- *bata* (child) → *mga bata* (children)
- *bahay* (house) → *mga bahay* (houses)
- *libro* (book) → *mga libro* (books)

Examples:

- *Ang mga bata ay naglalaro.*  
  (The children are playing.)
- *Bumili ako ng mga prutas.*  
  (I bought fruits.)

### Context

Often, plurality is understood from context without using *mga*:

- *Maraming tao sa palengke.*  
  (Many people at the market.) - *tao* understood as plural

### Reduplication

Some nouns use reduplication to indicate plurality or distribution:

- *bahay-bahay* (houses scattered about)
- *tao-tao* (various people)
- *puno-puno* (various trees)

::: details Reduplication Usage
Reduplication often suggests variety, distribution, or informality rather than simple plurality. It is less common than using *mga*.
:::

## Articles

Tagalog does not have equivalents to English articles "a," "an," or "the" in the same way. Definiteness is conveyed through markers and context.

### Definite Reference

Topic markers (*ang*, *si*) often indicate definiteness:

- *ang bahay* - the house (specific house)
- *si Juan* - Juan (specific person)

### Indefinite Reference

Non-topic markers (*ng*) suggest indefiniteness:

- *bumili ng bahay* - bought a house (some house)
- *may tao* - there is a person (some person)

::: tip Definiteness Context
Context and word order help clarify whether a noun is definite or indefinite. Topic position tends to suggest definiteness.
:::

## Possession

Possession in Tagalog is expressed in several ways.

### Using *Ng*-markers

The possessor follows the possessed noun with *ng* or *ni*:

- *bahay ng tao* (person's house)
- *libro ni Maria* (Maria's book)
- *mga anak ng guro* (teacher's children)

### Using Possessive Pronouns

Possessive pronouns can indicate ownership:

- *akin* (my/mine)
- *iyo* (your/yours)
- *kanya* (his/her/hers)
- *atin* (our/ours - inclusive)
- *amin* (our/ours - exclusive)
- *inyo* (your/yours - plural)
- *kanila* (their/theirs)

Examples:

- *Akin ang libro.*  
  (The book is mine.)
- *Bahay niya ito.*  
  (This is his/her house.)
- *Sasakyan namin yan.*  
  (That is our vehicle.)

### Using Linkers

Possessive constructions can use linkers:

- *bahay ko* (my house)
- *libro mo* (your book)
- *kotse niya* (his/her car)

## Noun Modifiers

Nouns can be modified by adjectives, other nouns, or clauses.

### Adjective + Noun

Adjectives precede nouns and use linkers (*na* / *-ng*):

- *malaking bahay*  
  (big house)
- *magandang dalaga*  
  (beautiful lady)
- *mataas na puno*  
  (tall tree)

### Noun + Adjective

Sometimes the order is reversed for emphasis:

- *bahay na malaki*  
  (house that is big)

### Noun + Noun

Nouns can modify other nouns:

- *bahay bato*  
  (stone house)
- *mesa de kahoy*  
  (wooden table - mixed with Spanish)

## Nominalized Forms

Verbs and adjectives can be nominalized (turned into nouns) through affixation.

### Using *Pag-* Prefix

Creates abstract nouns from verb roots:

- *kain* (eat) → *pagkain* (food)
- *luto* (cook) → *pagluto* (cooking)
- *ibig* (want) → *pag-ibig* (love)

### Using *Ka-* -*an* Circumfix

- *totoo* (true) → *katotohanan* (truth)
- *baguhan* (new) → *kabaguhan* (newness/novelty)

### Using *Mang-* Prefix

Creates nouns for people who do actions:

- *isda* (fish) → *mangingisda* (fisherman)
- *alaga* (care for) → *mang-aalaga* (caretaker)

### Using *Taga-* Prefix

Creates nouns indicating origin or occupation:

- *Mahilig ako sa paglalakbay.*  
  (I love traveling.)

  (The beauty of nature is admirable.)

## Compounds

Tagalog forms compound nouns by combining two or more words.

- *palengke* (market)

### Adjective + Noun

- *lalaki* (man/male)
- *babae* (woman/female)
- *anak na lalaki* (son)

## Diminutives and Augmentatives
