# Numbers in Tagalog

Tagalog uses two number systems: native Tagalog numbers and Spanish-derived numbers. Both systems remain in use today, with Spanish numbers being more common in everyday conversation.

## Cardinal Numbers

### Native Tagalog Numbers (1-10)

Native Tagalog numbers are the indigenous counting system used when counting objects with specific counters and in traditional or formal contexts.

| Number | Tagalog |
| ------ | ------- |
| 1 | *isa* |
| 2 | *dalawa* |
| 3 | *tatlo* |
| 4 | *apat* |
| 5 | *lima* |
| 6 | *anim* |
| 7 | *pito* |
| 8 | *walo* |
| 9 | *siyam* |
| 10 | *sampu* |

### Native Tagalog Numbers (Higher Values)

| Number | Tagalog |
| ------ | ------- |
| 20 | *dalawampu* |
| 30 | *tatlumpu* |
| 40 | *apatnapu* |
| 50 | *limampu* |
| 60 | *animnapu* |
| 70 | *pitumpu* |
| 80 | *walumpu* |
| 90 | *siyamnapu* |
| 100 | *sandaan* |
| 200 | *dalawang daan* |
| 1,000 | *isang libo* / *sanlibo* |
| 2,000 | *dalawang libo* |

For other numbers in the hundreds and thousands, combine a native number with *daan* (hundred) or *libo* (thousand):

- *tatlong daan* (300)
- *apat na libo* (4,000)

### Spanish-Derived Numbers (1-20)

Spanish-derived numbers are used for telling time and in some traditional contexts, though English numbers have largely replaced them for money, prices, and ages in modern conversation.

| Number | Tagalog |
| ------ | ------- |
| 1 | *uno* |
| 2 | *dos* |
| 3 | *tres* |
| 4 | *kwatro* |
| 5 | *singko* |
| 6 | *sais* |
| 7 | *siyete* |
| 8 | *otso* |
| 9 | *nuebe* |
| 10 | *diyes* |
| 11 | *onse* |
| 12 | *dose* |
| 13 | *trese* |
| 14 | *katorse* |
| 15 | *kinse* |
| 16 | *disisays* |
| 17 | *disisyete* |
| 18 | *diyesiotso* |
| 19 | *diyesinuebe* |
| 20 | *bente* |

### Spanish-Derived Numbers (Tens and Hundreds)

| Number | Tagalog |
| ------ | ------- |
| 30 | *trenta* |
| 40 | *kwarenta* |
| 50 | *singkwenta* |
| 60 | *sesenta* |
| 70 | *setenta* |
| 80 | *otsenta* |
| 90 | *nobenta* |
| 100 | *siyento* |
| 200 | *dos siyentos* / *dosientos* |
| 1,000 | *mil* |
| 1,000,000 | *milyon* |

::: tip Number Formation
Numbers between tens are formed by combining the tens digit with the ones digit: *bente uno* (21), *trenta dos* (32), *kwarenta tres* (43).
:::

::: info System Preference
English numbers dominate in modern usage for money, prices, ages, and telephone numbers. Spanish-derived numbers are used for telling time. Native Tagalog numbers are preferred when counting objects with nouns, in formal contexts, and for days/weeks/months/years.
:::

## Ordinal Numbers

Ordinal numbers indicate position or order in a sequence.

### Using *ika-* Prefix

The most common way to form ordinal numbers is by adding the prefix *ika-* to cardinal numbers.

| Position | Tagalog |
| -------- | ------- |
| 1st | *una* |
| 2nd | *ikalawa* / *pangalawa* |
| 3rd | *ikatlo* / *pangatlo* |
| 4th | *ikaapat* / *pang-apat* |
| 5th | *ikalima* / *panlima* |
| 6th | *ikaanim* / *pang-anim* |
| 7th | *ikapito* / *pampito* |
| 8th | *ikawalo* / *pangwalo* |
| 9th | *ikasiyam* / *pansiyam* |
| 10th | *ikasampu* / *pansampu* |

::: details Alternative Forms with *pang-*
Ordinal numbers can also be formed using the prefix *pang-*. This form is common in conversation. The prefix undergoes phonological changes based on the following sound:

- Before vowels or *l*: *pang-* → *pang-* (*pang-apat*, *pang-anim*, *pangatlo*)
- Before *p*, *b*, or *m*: *pang-* → *pam-* (*pampito*)
- Before other consonants: *pang-* → *pan-* (*panlima*, *pansiyam*)

Note that *una* (first) does not take the *ika-* or *pang-* prefix.
:::

Examples:

- *Ito ang unang araw ko sa trabaho.*  
  (This is my first day at work.)
- *Nakatira kami sa ikatlong palapag.*  
  (We live on the third floor.)
- *Siya ang ikalimang estudyante na dumating.*  
  (He is the fifth student to arrive.)

## Counting Objects

Native Tagalog numbers are typically used when counting specific objects, especially with measure words or counters.

### With Nouns

When native numbers precede nouns, they connect using a linker. The linker form depends on the final sound of the number:

- Numbers ending in a vowel use *-ng*: *tatlo* + *-ng* → *tatlong libro* (three books)
- Numbers ending in a consonant use *na*: *apat* + *na* → *apat na tao* (four people)

Examples:

- *tatlong libro*  
  (three books)
- *limang bahay*  
  (five houses)
- *walong buwan*  
  (eight months)

### With People

- *apat na tao*  
  (four people)
- *sampung bata*  
  (ten children)
- *dalawang guro*  
  (two teachers)

## Money and Prices

In modern conversation, English numbers (one, two, three, etc.) are predominantly used for money and prices. Spanish-derived numbers are still understood and used by some speakers.

Examples:

- *Magkano ito?*  
  (How much is this?)
- *Singkuwenta pesos.*  
  (Fifty pesos.)
- *Bente singko lang.*  
  (Only twenty-five.)
- *Dose pesos at singkuwenta sentimos.*  
  (Twelve pesos and fifty centavos.)

::: tip Casual Shorthand

:::

::: info Currency
The Philippine peso is divided into 100 centavos (*sentimos* in Tagalog). Prices are commonly stated in pesos, with centavos used for exact amounts.

## Time-Related Numbers

### Hours

Spanish numbers are used for stating hours:

- *Alas dos ng hapon.*  
  (Two o'clock in the afternoon.)

  (Twelve o'clock noon.)

### Days, Weeks, Months

Native numbers are typically used with time period nouns:

- *tatlong araw*  
  (three days)
- *limang linggo*  
  (five weeks)
- *anim na buwan*  
  (six months)
- *dalawang taon*  
  (two years)
