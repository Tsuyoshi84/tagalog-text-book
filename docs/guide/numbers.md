# Numbers in Tagalog

Tagalog uses two number systems: native Tagalog numbers and Spanish-derived numbers. Both systems remain in use today, with Spanish numbers being more common in everyday conversation.

## Cardinal Numbers

### Spanish-Derived Numbers (1-20)

Spanish-derived numbers are used in most everyday contexts, including telling time, counting money, and stating prices.

| Number | Tagalog | English |
| ------ | ------- | ------- |
| 1 | *uno* | one |
| 2 | *dos* | two |
| 3 | *tres* | three |
| 4 | *kwatro* | four |
| 5 | *singko* | five |
| 6 | *sais* | six |
| 7 | *siyete* | seven |
| 8 | *otso* | eight |
| 9 | *nuebe* | nine |
| 10 | *diyes* | ten |
| 11 | *onse* | eleven |
| 12 | *dose* | twelve |
| 13 | *trese* | thirteen |
| 14 | *katorse* | fourteen |
| 15 | *kinse* | fifteen |
| 16 | *disisays* | sixteen |
| 17 | *disisyete* | seventeen |
| 18 | *diyesiotso* | eighteen |
| 19 | *diyesinuebe* | nineteen |
| 20 | *bente* | twenty |

### Spanish-Derived Numbers (Tens and Hundreds)

| Number | Tagalog | English |
| ------ | ------- | ------- |
| 30 | *trenta* | thirty |
| 40 | *kwarenta* | forty |
| 50 | *singkwenta* | fifty |
| 60 | *sesenta* | sixty |
| 70 | *setenta* | seventy |
| 80 | *otsenta* | eighty |
| 90 | *nobenta* | ninety |
| 100 | *siyento* | one hundred |
| 200 | *dalawang daan* | two hundred |
| 1,000 | *mil* | one thousand |
| 1,000,000 | *milyon* | one million |

::: tip Number Formation
Numbers between tens are formed by combining the tens digit with the ones digit: *bente uno* (21), *trenta dos* (32), *kwarenta tres* (43).
:::

::: info System Preference
Spanish-derived numbers dominate in urban areas for everyday counting, money, time, and ages. Native numbers are preferred when counting objects with nouns, in formal contexts, and for days/weeks/months/years.
:::

### Native Tagalog Numbers (1-10)

Native Tagalog numbers are used when counting objects with specific counters and in traditional or formal contexts.

| Number | Tagalog | English |
| ------ | ------- | ------- |
| 1 | *isa* | one |
| 2 | *dalawa* | two |
| 3 | *tatlo* | three |
| 4 | *apat* | four |
| 5 | *lima* | five |
| 6 | *anim* | six |
| 7 | *pito* | seven |
| 8 | *walo* | eight |
| 9 | *siyam* | nine |
| 10 | *sampu* | ten |

### Native Tagalog Numbers (Higher Values)

| Number | Tagalog | English |
| ------ | ------- | ------- |
| 20 | *dalawampu* | twenty |
| 30 | *tatlumpu* | thirty |
| 40 | *apatnapu* | forty |
| 50 | *limampu* | fifty |
| 60 | *animnapu* | sixty |
| 70 | *pitumpu* | seventy |
| 80 | *walumpu* | eighty |
| 90 | *siyamnapu* | ninety |
| 100 | *sandaan* | one hundred |
| 200 | *dalawang daan* | two hundred |
| 1,000 | *isang libo* / *sanlibo* | one thousand |
| 2,000 | *dalawang libo* | two thousand |

For other numbers in the hundreds and thousands, combine a native number with *daan* (hundred) or *libo* (thousand):

- *tatlong daan* (300)
- *apat na libo* (4,000)

## Ordinal Numbers

Ordinal numbers indicate position or order in a sequence.

### Using *ika-* Prefix

The most common way to form ordinal numbers is by adding the prefix *ika-* to cardinal numbers.

| Position | Tagalog | English |
| -------- | ------- | ------- |
| 1st | *una* | first |
| 2nd | *ikalawa* / *pangalawa* | second |
| 3rd | *ikatlo* / *pangatlo* | third |
| 4th | *ikaapat* / *pang-apat* | fourth |
| 5th | *ikalima* / *panlima* | fifth |
| 6th | *ikaanim* / *pang-anim* | sixth |
| 7th | *ikapito* / *pampito* | seventh |
| 8th | *ikawalo* / *pangwalo* | eighth |
| 9th | *ikasiyam* / *pansiyam* | ninth |
| 10th | *ikasampu* / *pansampu* | tenth |

::: details Alternative Forms with *pang-*
Ordinal numbers can also be formed using the prefix *pang-*. This form is common in conversation. The prefix undergoes phonological changes based on the following sound:

- Before vowels or *l*: *pang-* → *pang-* (*pang-apat*, *pang-anim*, *pangatlo*)
- Before *p*, *b*, or *m*: *pang-* → *pam-* (*pampito*)
- Before other consonants: *pang-* → *pan-* (*panlima*, *pansiyam*)

Note that *una* (first) does not take the *ika-* or *pang-* prefix.

Examples:

- *Ito ang unang araw ko sa trabaho.*  
  (This is my first day at work.)
- *Nakatira kami sa ikatlong palapag.*  
  (We live on the third floor.)
- *Siya ang ikalimang estudyante na dumating.*  
  (He is the fifth student to arrive.)

## Counting Objects

Native Tagalog numbers are typically used when counting specific objects, especially with measure words or counters.

### With Nouns

- Numbers ending in a vowel use *-ng*: *tatlo* + *-ng* → *tatlong libro* (three books)

Examples:

- *tatlong libro*  
  (three books)
- *limang bahay*  
  (five houses)
- *walong buwan*  
  (eight months)

### With People

  (four people)

  (ten children)

  (Only twenty-five.)
