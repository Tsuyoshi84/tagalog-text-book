### Native Tagalog Numbers (Higher Values)

| Number | Tagalog | English |
| ------ | ------- | ------- |
| 20 | *dalawampu* | twenty |

## Ordinal Numbers

Ordinal numbers indicate position or order in a sequence.

### Using *ika-* Prefix

The most common way to form ordinal numbers is by adding the prefix *ika-* to cardinal numbers.

| -------- | ------- | ------- |
| 1st | *una* | first |
| 2nd | *ikalawa* / *pangalawa* | second |
| 3rd | *ikatlo* / *pangatlo* | third |
| 4th | *ikaapat* / *pang-apat* | fourth |
| 5th | *ikalima* / *panlima* | fifth |
| 6th | *ikaanim* / *pang-anim* | sixth |
| 7th | *ikapito* / *pampito* | seventh |
| 8th | *ikawalo* / *pangwalo* | eighth |
| 9th | *ikasiyam* / *pansiyam* | ninth |
| 10th | *ikasampu* / *pansampu* | tenth |

Ordinal numbers can also be formed using the prefix *pang-* (*pangalawa*, *pangatlo*). This form is common in conversation. The prefix sometimes changes to *pan-* or *pam-* to match the sound of the number it attaches to (e.g., *panlima*, *pampito*).
