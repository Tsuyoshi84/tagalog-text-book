## Common Mistakes

### ‚ùå Mistake 1: Confusing *Naman* with *Nga*

While both add emphasis, they serve different functions:

- ‚ùå Using *naman* when strong confirmation is needed
- ‚úÖ *Maganda nga ang bahay.* (The house is indeed beautiful. - confirming)
- ‚úÖ *Maganda naman ang bahay.* (The house is nice though. - softer, considering)
- üí° *Nga* confirms truth; *naman* softens or adds contrast.

### ‚ùå Mistake 2: Overusing *Naman*

Learners sometimes add *naman* to every sentence:

- ‚ùå *Kumain naman ako ng naman kanin naman.*
- ‚úÖ *Kumain naman ako ng kanin.*
- üí° Use *naman* purposefully for specific effects, not in every clause.

### ‚ùå Mistake 3: Wrong Position in Sentence

*Naman* must be placed correctly as an enclitic:

- ‚ùå *Naman maganda ang bahay.*
- ‚úÖ *Maganda naman ang bahay.*
- üí° *Naman* follows the word it modifies; it cannot start sentences.

### ‚ùå Mistake 4: Using *Naman* in Overly Formal Contexts

*Naman* is conversational and may sound too casual in formal speech:

- ‚ùå *Magandang umaga po naman.* (awkward in formal greeting)
- ‚úÖ *Magandang umaga po.* (proper formal greeting)
- ‚úÖ *Kamusta naman kayo?* (acceptable in semi-formal context)
- üí° Use *naman* in casual to semi-formal situations, not in highly formal speech.

- ‚úÖ *Hindi gaanong maganda, pero okay naman.*  
  (Not very beautiful, but it's okay though.)
- üí° *Naman* helps soften negative statements and make them less harsh.

### ‚ùå Mistake 6: Confusing *Na Naman* with *Na* + *Nga*

Different combinations have different meanings:

- *Late ka na naman.* (You're late again. - mild complaint)
- *Late ka na nga.* (You're already late indeed. - confirmation)
- üí° *Na naman* = repetition/again; *na nga* = already (emphatic).
