## Common Mistakes

### ❌ Mistake 1: Confusing *Naman* with *Nga*

While both add emphasis, they serve different functions:

- ❌ Using *naman* when strong confirmation is needed
- ✅ *Maganda nga ang bahay.* (The house is indeed beautiful. - confirming)
- ✅ *Maganda naman ang bahay.* (The house is nice though. - softer, considering)
- 💡 *Nga* confirms truth; *naman* softens or adds contrast.

### ❌ Mistake 2: Overusing *Naman*

Learners sometimes add *naman* to every sentence:

- ❌ *Kumain naman ako ng kanin naman.*
- ✅ *Kumain naman ako ng kanin.*
- 💡 Use *naman* purposefully for specific effects, not in every clause.

### ❌ Mistake 3: Wrong Position in Sentence

*Naman* must be placed correctly as an enclitic:

- ❌ *Naman maganda ang bahay.*
- ✅ *Maganda naman ang bahay.*
- 💡 *Naman* follows the word it modifies; it cannot start sentences.

### ❌ Mistake 4: Using *Naman* in Overly Formal Contexts

*Naman* is conversational and may sound too casual in formal speech:

- ❌ *Magandang umaga po naman.* (awkward in formal greeting)
- ✅ *Magandang umaga po.* (proper formal greeting)
- ✅ *Kamusta naman kayo?* (acceptable in semi-formal context)
- 💡 Use *naman* in casual to semi-formal situations, not in highly formal speech.

### ❌ Mistake 5: Missing the Softening Context

Using *naman* without understanding its softening effect:

- ❌ *Hindi maganda.* (blunt statement)
- ✅ *Hindi gaanong maganda, pero okay naman.*  
  (Not very beautiful, but it's okay though.)
- 💡 *Naman* helps soften negative statements and make them less harsh.

### ❌ Mistake 6: Confusing *Na Naman* with *Na* + *Nga*

Different combinations have different meanings:

- *Late ka na naman.* (You're late again. - mild complaint)
- *Late ka na nga.* (You're already late indeed. - confirmation)
- 💡 *Na naman* = repetition/again; *na nga* = already (emphatic).
