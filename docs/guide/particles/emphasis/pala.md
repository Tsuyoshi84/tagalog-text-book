## Common Mistakes

### ‚ùå Mistake 1: Using *Pala* for Known Information

*Pala* should only be used for newly discovered or realized information:

- ‚ùå *Ang ganda ng buwan pala.* (when looking at moon you already saw)
- ‚úÖ *Ang ganda ng buwan.* (simple statement)
- ‚úÖ *Ang ganda pala ng buwan!* (when you just looked up and noticed)
- üí° Use *pala* only when expressing something you just discovered or realized.

### ‚ùå Mistake 2: Confusing *Pala* with *Talaga*

Both can express emphasis, but serve different functions:

- ‚ùå *Maganda talaga ang buwan.* (emphasizing it's beautiful)
- ‚úÖ *Maganda pala ang buwan.* (discovered it's beautiful)
- üí° *Talaga* emphasizes truth; *pala* expresses discovery/surprise.

*Pala* must appear after the word or phrase it modifies:

- ‚úÖ *Kumain ako, uminom, at natulog.*
- üí° Use *pala* only when there's genuine surprise, realization, or correction.

### ‚ùå Mistake 5: Using *Pala* for Future Plans

*Pala* is for discovered information, not planned actions:

- ‚ùå *Pupunta pala ako bukas.* (doesn't make sense - you know your own plans)
- ‚úÖ *Pupunta ako bukas.*
- ‚úÖ *Pupunta pala siya bukas.* (just learned about their plan)
- üí° Don't use *pala* for information you already knew or planned yourself.
