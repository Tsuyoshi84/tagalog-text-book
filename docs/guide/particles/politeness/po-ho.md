Mastering these particles is crucial for appropriate and respectful communication in Filipino culture.

## Common Mistakes

### ‚ùå Mistake 1: Overusing *Po* in Every Position

Using *po/ho* excessively sounds unnatural:

- ‚ùå *Kumain po ako po ng po kanin po.*
  (I ate rice. ‚Äî overly inserting *po* on each word.)
- ‚úÖ *Kumain po ako ng kanin.*
  (I ate rice. ‚Äî natural placement of *po*.)
- üí° Use *po* once or twice per sentence, not on every word.

### ‚ùå Mistake 2: Omitting *Po* When Speaking to Elders

Forgetting to use *po/ho* with elders or authority figures:

- ‚ùå *Kumusta ka?*
  (How are you? ‚Äî said to an elder, disrespectful.)
- ‚úÖ *Kumusta po kayo?*
  (How are you? ‚Äî respectful.)
- üí° Always use *po/ho* with people older or in positions of authority.

### ‚ùå Mistake 3: Using *Po* with Peers

Overusing *po/ho* with friends creates awkward distance:

- ‚ùå *Tara na po tayo.*
  (Let's go now. ‚Äî said to a close friend, too formal.)
- ‚úÖ *Tara na tayo.*
  (Let's go now. ‚Äî appropriate for peers.)
- ‚úÖ *Tara na po tayo.*
  (Let's go now. ‚Äî acceptable when addressing an older friend respectfully.)
- üí° Use *po/ho* based on age and relationship, not universally.

  (Have you eaten? ‚Äî mixing informal *ka* with formal *po*.)
- ‚úÖ *Kumain na po kayo?*
  (Have you eaten? ‚Äî consistent formality with *kayo*.)
- üí° When using *po/ho*, pair with formal pronouns (*kayo*, *ninyo*, *inyo*).

### ‚ùå Mistake 5: Not Adjusting Based on Response

Not matching the formality level of the conversation:

- ‚ùå Continuing to use *po* after someone says "No need to be formal"
- ‚úÖ Adjust based on social cues and explicit requests
- üí° If someone older says *"Huwag na mag-po"* (Don't use po), you can reduce usage while maintaining basic respect.

### ‚ùå Mistake 6: Wrong Pronoun System

Forgetting to use the full formal pronoun set:

- ‚ùå *Kumusta po ang araw mo?*
  (How is your day? ‚Äî mixing formal *po* with informal *mo*.)

  (How is your day? ‚Äî consistent with formal *ninyo*.)
