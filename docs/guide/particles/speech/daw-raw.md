# Particles: *Daw* / *Raw*

The particles *daw* and *raw* are essential for reporting what someone else has said or conveying second-hand information in Tagalog. They function as hearsay markers, similar to "they said," "supposedly," or "reportedly" in English. Mastering these particles is crucial for natural conversation, as Filipinos frequently share information learned from others.

::: tip Quick Summary
*Daw* and *raw* mark reported speech or hearsay. Use *daw* after consonants and *raw* after vowels. They indicate that the information comes from someone else, not from direct experience. The choice between them is purely phonetic, not semantic.
:::

## Core Meanings

*Daw* and *raw* carry the same meaning but follow different phonetic rules. They indicate reported or second-hand information.

### 1. Reported Speech ("They Said," "He/She Said")

The primary function is to report what someone else has said:

- *Pupunta daw siya bukas.*  
  (He/she said he/she will go tomorrow. / He/she is supposedly going tomorrow.)
- *Maganda raw ang pelikula.*  
  (They said the movie is good.)
- *Sakit daw ng ulo niya.*  
  (He/she said his/her head hurts.)

::: info Information Source
*Daw/raw* clearly signals that the speaker is not the original source of information. This protects the speaker from responsibility for the accuracy of the statement.
:::

### 2. Hearsay and Second-Hand Information

Conveys information heard from others without personal verification:

- *Cancelled daw ang klase.*  
  (Class is supposedly cancelled. - heard from someone)
- *Mahal raw ang presyo doon.*  
  (Prices are reportedly expensive there.)
- *Mayaman daw ang pamilya nila.*  
  (Their family is supposedly rich. - gossip/hearsay)

### 3. Indirect Quotation

Transforms direct quotes into indirect speech:

**Direct:** *Sabi niya, "Pupunta ako bukas."*  
(He/she said, "I will go tomorrow.")

**Indirect:** *Pupunta daw siya bukas.*  
(He/she said he/she will go tomorrow.)

### 4. Uncertainty or Distance from Information

Adds a layer of uncertainty or detachment from the claim:

- *Totoo daw iyon.*  
  (That's supposedly true. - but I'm not certain)
- *Mahirap raw ang exam.*  
  (The exam is supposedly difficult. - according to others)

## Phonetic Rule: *Daw* After Consonants, *Raw* After Vowels

The choice between *daw* and *raw* is purely phonetic, based on the final sound of the preceding word.

### Use *Daw* After Consonants

When the preceding word ends with a consonant sound, use *daw*:

- *Mabait daw si Juan.*  
  (Juan is supposedly kind. - after consonant "n")
- *Magaling daw ang doktor.*  
  (The doctor is supposedly good. - after consonant "r")
- *Mahirap daw ang exam.*  
  (The exam is supposedly difficult. - after consonant "p")

::: tip Consonant Identification
Look at the final sound of the word before *daw/raw*, not the spelling. Even if written with a vowel, consider the pronunciation.
:::

### Use *Raw* After Vowels

When the preceding word ends with a vowel sound, use *raw*:

- *Busy raw si Maria.*  
  (Maria is supposedly busy. - after "y" which sounds like vowel "i")
- *Masaya raw ang party.*  
  (The party was supposedly fun. - after "ya")
- *Pumunta na raw sila.*  
  (They supposedly already went. - after "na" ending in vowel)

### Common Pattern Examples

| Preceding Word | Ends With | Particle | Example | Translation |
| -------------- | --------- | -------- | ------- | ----------- |
| *siya* | vowel "a" | *raw* | *Siya raw ang darating.* | He/she is supposedly the one coming. |
| *ako* | vowel "o" | *raw* | *Ako raw ang tinawag nila.* | I'm supposedly the one they called. |
| *kayo* | vowel "o" | *raw* | *Kayo raw ang bahala dito.* | You all are supposedly in charge here. |
| *sila* | vowel "a" | *raw* | *Sila raw ang nagdesisyon.* | They supposedly made the decision. |
| *Juan* | consonant "n" | *daw* | *Juan daw ang tumawag.* | Juan supposedly made the call. |
| *gutom* | consonant "m" | *daw* | *Gutom daw sila.* | They are supposedly hungry. |
| *mabait* | consonant "t" | *daw* | *Mabait daw ang guro.* | The teacher is supposedly kind. |
| *sakit* | consonant "t" | *daw* | *Sakit daw ng ulo niya.* | His/her head supposedly hurts. |

::: warning Common Confusion
Native speakers sometimes interchange *daw* and *raw* in rapid speech, but the phonetic rule is the standard. As a learner, following the rule will sound more natural.
:::

## Usage Patterns and Sentence Positions

*Daw* and *raw* are enclitic particles that typically follow the word or phrase being reported.

### After the Main Verb

Commonly placed after the verb in the sentence:

- *Uuwi raw siya ngayon.*
  (He/she is supposedly going home now.)
- *Bumalik daw sila kagabi.*
  (They supposedly came back last night.)
- *Natulog na raw ang bata.*
  (The child supposedly already slept.)

### After the Subject

Can follow the subject for emphasis:

- *Si Maria raw ay may sakit.*  
  (Maria supposedly is sick.)
- *Ang nanay niya daw ay doktor.*  
  (His/her mother is supposedly a doctor.)
- *Sila raw ang nanalo.*  
  (They supposedly won.)

### After Adjectives or Descriptive Phrases

Places the hearsay marker on the description:

  (The place is supposedly really beautiful.)
- *Mahirap daw ang trabaho.*  
  (The work is supposedly difficult.)
- *Mura raw ang pagkain doon.*  
  (Food is supposedly cheap there.)

### After Question Words (Indirect Questions)

Used in reporting questions someone asked:

- *Nasaan daw si Ana?*  
  (Where is Ana supposedly? / Where did they say Ana is?)
- *Kailan raw ang meeting?*  
  (When is the meeting supposedly? / When did they say the meeting is?)
- *Sino daw ang dumating?*  
  (Who supposedly arrived? / Who did they say arrived?)

  (He/she supposedly has no money.)
- *Hindi pa raw tapos ang trabaho.*  
  (The work supposedly isn't finished yet.)

## Common Combinations

*Daw* and *raw* combine with other particles to create nuanced meanings.

### *Daw/Raw* + *Ba* (Question About Hearsay)

Asks to confirm reported information:

- *Pupunta daw ba siya?*  
  (Did he/she say he/she is going? / Is he/she supposedly going?)
- *Totoo raw ba iyan?*  
  (Is that supposedly true? / Did they say that's true?)
- *Sakit daw ba ng ulo mo?*  
  (Did you say your head hurts?)

### *Sabi* + *Daw/Raw* (Redundant but Common)

Combines "said" with the hearsay marker for emphasis:

  (He/she said he/she is going. - emphasizing it's reported)
- *Sabi nila, masarap raw ang pagkain.*  
  (They said the food is delicious. - double reporting marker)

::: info Usage Note
While *sabi* already means "said," combining it with *daw/raw* is common and natural in conversation, adding emphasis to the hearsay nature.
:::

Reports someone's given reason:

- *Absent daw kasi may sakit.*  
  (Absent supposedly because sick.)

  (Supposedly kind though.)

## Nuances and Tone

::: warning Cultural Sensitivity

:::

### Protecting the Speaker

## Common Mistakes

### ‚ùå Mistake 1: Using the Wrong Phonetic Form

Mixing up *daw* and *raw* based on the wrong phonetic pattern:

- ‚ùå *Sila daw ay pupunta.* (after vowel "a")
- ‚úÖ *Sila raw ay pupunta.*
- ‚ùå *Si Juan raw ay galing.* (after consonant "n")
- ‚úÖ *Si Juan daw ay galing.*
- üí° Check the final sound of the preceding word: vowel ‚Üí *raw*, consonant ‚Üí *daw*.

### ‚ùå Mistake 2: Placing *Daw/Raw* at the Beginning

*Daw* and *raw* cannot start a sentence:

- ‚ùå *Daw pumunta siya.*
- ‚úÖ *Pumunta daw siya.*
- üí° These particles are enclitic and must follow another word.

### ‚ùå Mistake 3: Using *Daw/Raw* for Direct Experience

Don't use *daw/raw* when reporting your own direct experience:

- ‚ùå *Kumain daw ako.* (reporting about yourself as hearsay - awkward)
- ‚úÖ *Kumain ako.* (direct statement)
- ‚úÖ *Kumain daw siya.* (reporting about someone else)
- üí° *Daw/raw* is for information from others, not personal experience.

**Exception:** Quoting yourself in indirect speech when someone is asking what you said:

- *Ano raw sabi mo?* (What did you say?)
- *Pupunta raw ako bukas.* (I said I'm going tomorrow. - acceptable)

### ‚ùå Mistake 4: Overusing in Written Formal Text

*Daw/raw* is primarily conversational; overuse in formal writing seems unprofessional:

- ‚ùå Academic paper: *Ang resulta daw ay positibo.*
- ‚úÖ Conversation: *Positibo daw ang resulta.*
- ‚úÖ Formal writing: *Ayon sa ulat, positibo ang resulta.* (According to the report...)
- üí° Use formal reporting verbs (*ayon sa*, *sang-ayon sa*) in formal contexts.

### ‚ùå Mistake 5: Confusing with *Daw* as a Verb

*Daw* as a particle differs from *daw* in older or poetic expressions meaning "as if" or "seemingly":

- Particle: *Maganda daw ang bahay.* (The house is supposedly beautiful.)
- Poetic: *Bulaklak na daw sa langit.* (Like a flower from heaven. - old poetic usage)
- üí° Context distinguishes them; the particle *daw/raw* is far more common in modern speech.

### ‚ùå Mistake 6: Using with Strong Personal Assertions

Don't use *daw/raw* when making your own strong claim:

- ‚ùå *Totoo daw ito!* (This is supposedly true! - contradictory when asserting)
- ‚úÖ *Totoo ito!* (This is true! - direct assertion)
- ‚úÖ *Totoo daw yan sabi niya.* (He/she said that's true. - reporting)
- üí° If you're certain and it's your claim, don't use hearsay markers.

## Comparisons with Direct Speech

Understanding how *daw/raw* transforms direct speech helps with proper usage.

### Direct vs. Indirect Speech

| Direct Speech | With *Daw/Raw* (Indirect) | English |
| ------------- | ------------------------- | ------- |
| Sabi niya: *"Pupunta ako."* | *Pupunta daw siya.* | He/she said: "I will go." / He/she said he/she will go. |
| Sabi niya: *"Masarap ang pagkain."* | *Masarap daw ang pagkain.* | He/she said: "The food is delicious." / The food is supposedly delicious. |
| Sabi nila: *"Tapos na ang trabaho."* | *Tapos na daw ang trabaho.* | They said: "The work is finished." / The work is supposedly finished. |
| Sabi ko: *"Gutom ako."* | *Gutom daw ako.* (quoted) | I said: "I'm hungry." / I said I'm hungry. |

::: info Pronoun Shift
Notice how pronouns shift in indirect speech: *ako* (I) becomes *siya* (he/she), *kami* (we) becomes *sila* (they) when reporting.
:::

### Alternative Reporting Constructions

*Daw/raw* is more casual than formal reporting phrases:

| Casual (*Daw/Raw*) | Formal Alternative | English |
| ------------------ | ------------------ | ------- |
| *Maganda daw ang lugar.* | *Ayon sa kanya, maganda ang lugar.* | The place is supposedly beautiful. / According to him/her, the place is beautiful. |
| *Cancelled raw ang event.* | *Sang-ayon sa anunsyo, kinansela ang event.* | The event is supposedly cancelled. / According to the announcement, the event is cancelled. |
| *Mahusay daw ang doktor.* | *Batay sa mga review, mahusay ang doktor.* | The doctor is supposedly good. / Based on reviews, the doctor is good. |

### Omitting *Daw/Raw* Changes Meaning

Removing *daw/raw* makes the statement a direct claim:

- *Maganda ang pelikula.* (The movie is beautiful. - I'm stating this)
- *Maganda daw ang pelikula.* (The movie is supposedly beautiful. - others said this)
- *Sakit ng ulo ko.* (My head hurts. - direct experience)

- Creates social bonds through shared information (chismis/tsismis)

::: warning Social Awareness
While gossip is culturally common, be mindful of the ethical implications of spreading unverified information about others, even with *daw/raw*.
:::

### Politeness and Indirectness

Using *daw/raw* aligns with Filipino indirect communication style:

- Softens criticism by attributing it to others
- Allows compliments to be delivered indirectly
- Maintains harmony by avoiding direct confrontation

### Protecting Relationships

*Daw/raw* helps maintain social harmony:

- Distances the speaker from potentially controversial information
- Avoids personal responsibility for accuracy
- Allows information to be shared without personal endorsement

### Regional Variations

Usage patterns and frequency vary by region:

- Urban areas (especially Metro Manila) use *daw/raw* frequently in daily conversation
- Some regions have local variations or related particles
- Formality level influences usage (less common in very formal settings)

::: info Similar Expressions
Other Philippine languages have similar hearsay markers: Cebuano *kuno/kon√≥*, Ilocano *kun√†/kun√°*.

## Summary

Key points about *daw* and *raw*:

- **Primary function**: Reported speech, hearsay, second-hand information
- **Phonetic rule**: *Daw* after consonants, *raw* after vowels (same meaning)
- **Position**: Enclitic - follows the word or phrase being reported
- **Cultural role**: Facilitates information sharing, protects speaker, enables indirect communication
- **Common combinations**: *daw/raw ba* (question about hearsay), *daw/raw pala* (surprised hearsay), *daw/raw kasi* (reported reason)
- **Tone variations**: Neutral reporting, skepticism, gossip, protection, sarcasm
- **Learning focus**: Master phonetic rule first, then practice reporting direct to indirect speech, then add nuanced tones
