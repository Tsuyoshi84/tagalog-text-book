## Common Mistakes

### ‚ùå Mistake 1: Confusing *Na* with *Pa*

The most common error is mixing up *na* (already) and *pa* (still/yet):

- ‚ùå *Kumain pa ako.* (when meaning "I already ate")
- ‚úÖ *Kumain na ako.* (I already ate.)
- ‚úÖ *Kumakain pa ako.* (I'm still eating.)
- üí° *Na* = completed/changed; *Pa* = ongoing/not yet completed.

### ‚ùå Mistake 2: Omitting *Na* When Needed

Learners sometimes forget *na* in completion contexts:

- ‚ùå *Tapos ang trabaho.* (sounds incomplete)
- ‚úÖ *Tapos na ang trabaho.* (The work is finished already.)
- üí° *Na* is crucial for marking completed states.

### ‚ùå Mistake 3: Wrong Position in Sentence

*Na* must follow the word it modifies:

- ‚ùå *Na kumain ako.*
- ‚úÖ *Kumain na ako.*
- üí° *Na* is enclitic and cannot start a sentence.

### ‚ùå Mistake 4: Using *Na* with Future Tense

*Na* indicates completion or current state, not future:

- ‚ùå *Kakain na ako bukas.* (awkward - future but using *na*)
- ‚úÖ *Kakain ako bukas.* (I will eat tomorrow.)
- ‚úÖ *Kumain na ako.* (I already ate.)
- üí° Use plain future tense for future actions; save *na* for completed or immediate actions.

### ‚ùå Mistake 5: Translating *Na* as "Now" Always

*Na* doesn't always mean "now" in English:

- ‚ùå Thinking *Matanda na siya* means "He is old now" literally
- ‚úÖ Understanding it means "He has become old" (change of state)
- üí° *Na* marks a transition more than a specific time point.

### ‚ùå Mistake 6: Thinking *Na* Contradicts Progressive Aspect

Learners sometimes avoid combining *na* with ongoing forms even when the action has already started:

- ‚ùå *Kumakain ako ngayon lang.* (unnatural when meaning "I'm eating already.")
- ‚úÖ *Kumakain na ako.* (I'm already eating. / I've started eating now.)
- ‚úÖ *Nagsisimula na siyang kumain.* (He/she is starting to eat now.)
- üí° *Na* can appear with progressive aspect to show that an ongoing action has begun; use *pa* only for "still doing."
