## Common Mistakes

### ‚ùå Mistake 1: Confusing *Pa* with *Na*

The most common error is mixing up *pa* (still/yet) and *na* (already):

- ‚ùå *Kumain na ako.* (when meaning "I'm still eating")
- ‚úÖ *Kumakain pa ako.* (I'm still eating.)
- ‚ùå *Kumain pa ako.* (when meaning "I already ate")
- ‚úÖ *Kumain na ako.* (I already ate.)
- üí° *Pa* = ongoing/not yet; *Na* = completed/already done.

### ‚ùå Mistake 2: Wrong Verb Aspect with *Pa*

Using completed aspect with *pa* when expressing continuation:

- ‚ùå *Kumain pa ako.* (incorrect aspect for "still eating")
- ‚úÖ *Kumakain pa ako.* (I'm still eating.)
- üí° Use progressive/imperfective aspect with *pa* for ongoing actions.

### ‚ùå Mistake 3: Omitting *Hindi* with Negative *Pa*

Forgetting negation when expressing "not yet":

- ‚ùå *Pa ako kumain.* (incorrect)
- ‚úÖ *Hindi pa ako kumain.* (I haven't eaten yet.)
- üí° Use *hindi pa* or *wala pa* for "not yet."

### ‚ùå Mistake 4: Wrong Position in Sentence

*Pa* must follow the word it modifies:

- ‚ùå *Pa kumakain ako.*
- ‚úÖ *Kumakain pa ako.*
- üí° *Pa* is enclitic and cannot start a sentence (except in very informal short responses).

### ‚ùå Mistake 5: Using *Pa* with Completed Past

Using *pa* with actions that are clearly finished:

- ‚ùå *Kumain pa ako kahapon.* (awkward - yesterday but using *pa*)
- ‚úÖ *Kumain na ako kahapon.* (I already ate yesterday.)
- ‚úÖ *Kumakain pa ako noon.* (I was still eating then.)
- üí° *Pa* indicates ongoing or not-yet states, not completed past actions.

### ‚ùå Mistake 6: Confusing "More" vs. "Still"

Not distinguishing between continuation and additional quantity:

- Context matters:
  - *Kumakain pa ako.* = I'm still eating. (continuation)
  - *Gusto ko pa ng rice.* = I want more rice. (additional)
- üí° Both meanings are valid; context clarifies which meaning applies.
