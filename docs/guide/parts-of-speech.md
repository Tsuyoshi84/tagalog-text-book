# Parts of Speech

Tagalog grammar categorizes words into several parts of speech, each serving specific functions in sentences. Understanding these categories helps learners construct grammatically correct sentences and comprehend how Tagalog expresses meaning.

## Overview of Tagalog Parts of Speech

Tagalog has nine main parts of speech:

| Part of Speech | Tagalog Term | Function | Example |
| -------------- | ------------ | -------- | ------- |
| Verb | *pandiwa* | Express actions or states | *kumain* (ate), *maganda* (beautiful) |
| Noun | *pangngalan* | Name persons, places, things | *bahay* (house), *tao* (person) |
| Adjective | *pang-uri* | Describe or modify nouns | *malaki* (big), *mabait* (kind) |
| Pronoun | *panghalip* | Replace nouns | *siya* (he/she), *ako* (I) |
| Adverb | *pang-abay* | Modify verbs, adjectives | *mabilis* (quickly), *doon* (there) |
| Preposition | *pang-ukol* | Show relationships | *sa* (to/at/in), *mula* (from) |
| Conjunction | *pangatnig* | Connect words/clauses | *at* (and), *pero* (but) |
| Particle | *partikulo* | Grammatical markers | *ang*, *ng*, *na* |
| Interjection | *pandamdam* | Express emotions | *Ay!* (Oh!), *Naku!* (Oh my!) |

## Verbs (*Pandiwa*)

Verbs in Tagalog are complex, featuring a focus system, aspect marking, and extensive affixation. They express actions, states, or occurrences.

### Types of Verbs

- **Action verbs**: *kumain* (ate), *tumakbo* (ran)
- **State verbs**: *mahal* (love), *gusto* (like/want)
- **Existential verbs**: *may* (have/there is), *wala* (none/there is not)

### Verb Characteristics

Tagalog verbs conjugate for:

1. **Aspect**: Completed, ongoing, contemplated
2. **Focus**: Actor, object, location, beneficiary, instrument
3. **Affixation**: Various prefixes, infixes, and suffixes

Examples:

- *Kumain ako.*  
  (I ate.) - completed aspect, actor focus
- *Kinain ko ang tinapay.*  
  (I ate the bread.) - completed aspect, object focus

::: tip Verb Predicates
In Tagalog, adjectives function as verbs when used as predicates: *Maganda ang bahay.* (The house is beautiful.)

## Nouns (*Pangngalan*)

Nouns name people, places, things, or concepts. Tagalog nouns do not inflect for number or gender.

### Types of Nouns

- **Common nouns**: *bahay* (house), *libro* (book)
- **Proper nouns**: *Juan*, *Manila*, *Pilipinas*
- **Abstract nouns**: *pag-ibig* (love), *kalayaan* (freedom)

### Articles and Markers

Nouns are preceded by particles that indicate their grammatical function:

| Marker | Use | Example |

| *ang* | Topic marker (common noun) | *ang bahay* (the house) |
| *si* | Topic marker (proper noun) | *si Maria* (Maria) |
| *ng* | Non-topic marker (common) | *ng tao* (of person) |

Examples:

- *Maganda ang bahay.*  
  (The house is beautiful.)

## Adjectives (*Pang-uri*)

Adjectives describe or modify nouns and can function as predicates in Tagalog sentences.

### Adjective Forms

- *maganda* (beautiful)
- *mabait* (kind)
- *malaki* (big)

### Usage Patterns

#### As Predicates

## Particles (*Partikulo*)

Particles are grammatical markers that indicate relationships between words and phrases. They are crucial to Tagalog grammar.

### Case Markers

- *ang* - topic marker (definite)
- *ng* - non-topic marker / possessive
- *sa* - locative / directional

### Linkers

- *na* - after vowels
- *-ng* - after consonants

These connect modifiers to nouns or clauses to each other.

### Other Particles

- *ay* - inverted sentence marker
- *ba* - question particle
- *po* / *ho* - politeness markers
- *na* - already / now (different from linker *na*)
- *pa* - still / yet / more

Examples:

- *Kumain na ako.*  
  (I already ate.)
- *Kumakain pa siya.*  
  (He/She is still eating.)
- *Kumain ka na ba?*  
  (Have you eaten yet?)

## Interjections (*Pandamdam*)

Interjections express emotions or reactions and stand apart from sentence structure.

Common interjections:

- *Ay!* (Oh!)
- *Naku!* (Oh my!)
- *Aba!* (Well!)
- *Sayang!* (What a waste!)
- *Grabe!* (Wow! / Intense!)
- *Talaga?* (Really?)

## Word Formation

### Reduplication

Reduplication is common in Tagalog for various functions:

- **Intensity**: *mabilis* → *mabilis-bilis* (quite fast)
- **Plurality/Repetition**: *bata* → *bata-bata* (children/childish)
- **Ongoing aspect**: *kain* → *kakain* (will eat)

### Affixation

Affixes modify root words to create new meanings:

- **Prefixes**: *mag-*, *um-*, *ma-*
- **Infixes**: *-um-*, *-in-*
- **Suffixes**: *-an*, *-in*, *-han*

Examples:

- *kain* (eat) → *kumain* (ate) - infix
- *kain* (eat) → *kakain* (will eat) - reduplication
- *kain* (eat) → *pagkain* (food) - prefix + suffix

## Function Words vs. Content Words

### Content Words

Words that carry main meaning:

- Nouns, verbs, adjectives, most adverbs

### Function Words

Words that serve grammatical purposes:

- Particles, conjunctions, some pronouns

::: tip Learning Strategy
Focus first on content words to build vocabulary, then master function words to improve grammar accuracy.

## Summary

Understanding Tagalog parts of speech provides the foundation for constructing sentences and expressing ideas accurately. Each part of speech has specific roles and rules, with particles and the verb system being particularly distinctive features of Tagalog grammar.

Key points:

1. Verbs use affixation for focus and aspect
2. Nouns require appropriate markers (*ang*, *ng*, *sa*)
3. Adjectives can function as predicates
4. Pronouns have different forms for different grammatical roles
5. Particles are essential for grammatical relationships
6. Linkers connect modifiers to nouns
