# Tagalog Pronunciation

Tagalog pronunciation is relatively straightforward for English speakers, as it follows consistent phonetic rules. Each letter typically represents one sound, making it easier to read and pronounce words once the basic sounds are learned.

## Vowels

Tagalog has five vowel sounds, similar to Spanish. Each vowel maintains a consistent pronunciation.

| Vowel | Pronunciation | Example | English |
| ----- | ------------- | ------- | ------- |
| *a* | like "a" in "father" | *anak* | child |
| *e* | like "e" in "bed" | *edi* | then |
| *i* | like "ee" in "see" | *isa* | one |
| *o* | like "o" in "go" | *oso* | bear |
| *u* | like "oo" in "food" | *ulo* | head |

::: tip Vowel Clarity
Tagalog vowels are always clear and distinct. Unlike English, vowels do not become neutral or schwa sounds when unstressed.
:::

Examples:

- *maganda*  
  (beautiful)
- *kumain*  
  (ate)
- *puso*  
  (heart)

## Consonants

Most Tagalog consonants are pronounced similarly to English, with a few exceptions.

### Standard Consonants

| Consonant | Pronunciation | Example | English |
| --------- | ------------- | ------- | ------- |
| *b* | like English "b" | *bahay* | house |
| *k* | like English "k" | *kain* | eat |
| *d* | like English "d" | *daan* | road |
| *g* | always hard like "g" in "go" | *gabi* | night |
| *h* | like English "h" | *hari* | king |
| *l* | like English "l" | *lupa* | earth |
| *m* | like English "m" | *mata* | eye |
| *n* | like English "n" | *noo* | forehead |
| *p* | like English "p" | *paa* | foot |
| *s* | like English "s" | *saya* | happiness |
| *t* | like English "t" | *tao* | person |
| *w* | like English "w" | *wala* | none |
| *y* | like English "y" | *yelo* | ice |

### Special Consonants

| Consonant | Pronunciation | Example | English |
| --------- | ------------- | ------- | ------- |
| *ng* | like "ng" in "sing" (one sound) | *ngayon* | now |
| *r* | lightly rolled or flapped | *rosas* | rose |

::: info The *ng* Sound
The *ng* combination represents a single consonant sound in Tagalog, not two separate sounds. It appears at the beginning, middle, or end of words.
:::

Examples with *ng*:

- *ngiti*  
  (smile)
- *tanga*  
  (fool)
- *matagal ng panahon*  
  (long time ago)

## Diphthongs

Diphthongs are combinations of two vowels pronounced as one syllable.

Common diphthongs in Tagalog:

| Diphthong | Pronunciation | Example | English |
| --------- | ------------- | ------- | ------- |
| *ay* | like "eye" | *bayani* | hero |
| *aw* | like "ow" in "cow" | *tawag* | call |
| *oy* | like "oy" in "boy" | *aboy* | shout |
| *iw* | like "ew" in "few" | *sisiw* | chick |

## Stress and Accent

Stress placement in Tagalog can change word meaning. Stress typically falls on the second-to-last syllable, but there are exceptions.

### Stress Patterns

| Pattern | Example | English |
| ------- | ------- | ------- |
| Penultimate stress | *bahay* (ba-HAY) | house |
| Final stress | *babá* (ba-BA) | chin |
| Glottal stop | *batà* (ba-TA') | child |

::: warning Stress Matters
Stress can distinguish words: *basa* (wet) vs. *basá* (read). Pay attention to stress markers in learning materials.
:::

Examples showing stress differences:

- *aso* (dog) - stress on first syllable
- *puso* (heart) - stress on first syllable
- *pusó* (salt) - stress on second syllable

## Glottal Stop

The glottal stop (represented by *'* or unmarked) is a brief pause in airflow, similar to the middle sound in "uh-oh."

Examples:

- *puno* (tree) vs. *punò* (full) - with glottal stop
- *bata* (robe) vs. *batà* (child) - with glottal stop

::: details Glottal Stop in Writing
In formal writing, the glottal stop may be indicated by a grave accent (`) over the vowel or by an apostrophe ('). In casual writing, it is often unmarked.
:::

## Syllabication

Tagalog words are divided into syllables following consistent rules:

1. Each syllable contains one vowel sound
2. Consonants between vowels typically belong to the following syllable
3. Consonant clusters may be split or stay together depending on pronunciation

Examples:

- *kumain* → ku-ma-in (ate)
- *maganda* → ma-gan-da (beautiful)
- *tao* → ta-o (person)
- *ngayon* → nga-yon (now)

## Intonation

Tagalog uses rising intonation for questions and falling intonation for statements.

### Statement Intonation

- *Kumain siya.*  
  (He/She ate.) - falling intonation

### Question Intonation

- *Kumain siya?*  
  (Did he/she eat?) - rising intonation

::: tip Yes/No Questions
Questions without question words use rising intonation at the end to distinguish them from statements.
:::

## Common Pronunciation Challenges

### For English Speakers

1. **The *ng* sound at word beginning**: Practice saying "singing" and isolate the "ng" sound
   - *ngayon* (now)
   - *ngipin* (tooth)

2. **Clear vowel sounds**: Avoid reducing vowels to schwa
   - Keep *a* as "ah" even in unstressed syllables

3. **Light *r* sound**: Use a single tap, not the English rolled "r"
   - *rosas* (rose)
   - *araw* (sun/day)

4. **Glottal stop**: Practice the brief pause
   - *batà* (child)
   - *pusò* (salt)

## Practice Words

### Basic Words

- *salamat*  
  (thank you)
- *oo*  
  (yes)
- *hindi*  
  (no)
- *kumusta*  
  (how are you)

### Words with *ng*

- *ngayon*  
  (now)
- *aling*  
  (which)
- *malang*  
  (unlucky)

### Words with Stress Differences
