# Sentence Structure

Tagalog sentence structure differs significantly from English. The most common word order is Verb-Subject-Object (VSO), though Subject-Verb-Object (SVO) is also used, particularly in casual speech.

## Basic Word Order

### Verb-Subject-Object (VSO)

The standard formal word order in Tagalog places the verb first, followed by the subject (marked with *ang*), then the object.

- *Kumain ang bata ng mangga.*  
  (The child ate a mango.)
- *Bumili si Maria ng libro.*  
  (Maria bought a book.)
- *Nagluto ang nanay ng pagkain.*  
  (Mother cooked food.)

### Subject-Verb-Object (SVO)

In casual conversation, speakers often use SVO order, similar to English.

- *Ang bata ay kumain ng mangga.*  
  (The child ate a mango.)
- *Si Maria ay bumili ng libro.*  
  (Maria bought a book.)
- *Ang nanay ay nagluto ng pagkain.*  
  (Mother cooked food.)

::: tip Word Order Flexibility
Both VSO and SVO are grammatically correct. VSO is more formal and traditional, while SVO is common in everyday speech. The meaning remains the same.

## Sentence Components

### The Predicate

The predicate is typically the first element in a Tagalog sentence. It can be a verb, adjective, noun, or prepositional phrase.

#### Verb Predicate

- *Tumatakbo ang aso.*  
  (The dog is running.)

#### Adjective Predicate

- *Maganda ang bahay.*  
  (The house is beautiful.)

#### Noun Predicate

- *Guro si Juan.*  
  (Juan is a teacher.)

#### Prepositional Phrase Predicate

- *Sa kusina ang tatay.*  
  (Father is in the kitchen.)

### The Topic

The topic is the main focus of the sentence, marked by *ang* (or its variants *si*, *sina*, *ang mga*). It typically follows the predicate in VSO sentences.

- *Kumakanta ang babae.*  
  (The woman is singing.)
- *Mabait si Pedro.*  
  (Pedro is kind.)

## Particles

Tagalog uses particles to mark grammatical relationships in sentences.

| Particle | Function | Example |
| -------- | -------- | ------- |
| *ang* | Topic marker (definite, common nouns) | *Kumain ang bata.* (The child ate.) |
| *si* | Topic marker (proper nouns, singular) | *Kumain si Maria.* (Maria ate.) |
| *sina* | Topic marker (proper nouns, plural) | *Kumain sina Maria at Juan.* (Maria and Juan ate.) |
| *ng* | Object marker / Possessive | *Kumain ng tinapay ang bata.* (The child ate bread.) |
| *ni* | Actor marker (proper nouns, singular) | *Kinain ni Maria ang tinapay.* (The bread was eaten by Maria.) |
| *nina* | Actor marker (proper nouns, plural) | *Kinain nina Maria at Juan ang tinapay.* (The bread was eaten by Maria and Juan.) |
| *sa* | Locative / Directional | *Pumunta sa tindahan ang nanay.* (Mother went to the store.) |
| *ay* | Inversion particle linking the fronted topic (still marked by *ang*, *si*, or *sina*) to the predicate | *Ang bata ay kumain.* (The child ate.) |

See also: [Particles](./particles/index.md)

## The *Ay* Inversion

The particle *ay* inverts the sentence structure from VSO to SVO. It links the fronted topic—still marked by *ang*, *si*, or *sina*—to the predicate, allowing the topic to appear first in the sentence without replacing the case markers.

### Without *Ay* (VSO)

- *Maganda ang dalaga.*  
  (The lady is beautiful.)

### With *Ay* (SVO)

- *Ang dalaga ay maganda.*  
  (The lady is beautiful.)

::: info Usage Note
The *ay* inversion is optional and does not change the meaning. It is often used for emphasis or stylistic reasons.
:::

More examples:

- *Kumain ang bata.* → *Ang bata ay kumain.*  
  (The child ate.)
- *Natutulog si Ana.* → *Si Ana ay natutulog.*  
  (Ana is sleeping.)

## Sentence Types

### Declarative Sentences

Declarative sentences make statements and follow the word orders described above.

- *Umuulan ngayon.*  
  (It is raining now.)
- *Masarap ang pagkain.*  
  (The food is delicious.)

### Interrogative Sentences

Questions can be formed by adding question words or using rising intonation.

#### Yes/No Questions

Yes/no questions use rising intonation and often add the question particle *ba*.

- *Kumain ka na ba?*  
  (Have you eaten yet?)
- *Pupunta ka ba sa pista?*  
  (Will you go to the festival?)

#### Wh-Questions

Questions with question words (*sino*, *ano*, *saan*, etc.) replace the relevant sentence element.

- *Sino ang kumain?*  
  (Who ate?)
- *Ano ang binili mo?*  
  (What did you buy?)
- *Saan ka pupunta?*  
  (Where are you going?)

### Imperative Sentences

Commands and requests often omit the subject.

- *Kumain ka.*  
  (Eat.)
- *Pumunta ka dito.*  
  (Come here.)
- *Matulog ka na.*  
  (Go to sleep now.)

Polite imperatives use *paki-* prefix:

- *Pakiusap, magtayo.*  
  (Please stand.)
- *Pakisara ang pinto.*  
  (Please close the door.)

### Exclamatory Sentences

Exclamations express strong emotion and often use exclamatory words.

- *Ang ganda naman!*  
  (How beautiful!)
- *Grabe!*  
  (Wow! / Amazing!)
- *Sayang!*  
  (What a waste!)

## Existential Sentences

Existential sentences express the existence or location of something using *may* (there is/are) or *wala* (there is/are not).

### Positive Existential

- *May pagkain sa mesa.*  
  (There is food on the table.)
- *May tao sa labas.*  
  (There is someone outside.)

### Negative Existential

- *Walang tao sa bahay.*  
  (There is no one in the house.)
- *Walang problema.*  
  (There is no problem.)

::: tip *May* vs. *Mayroon*
*May* is used before nouns, while *mayroon* stands alone. Both mean "there is/are."

- *May libro ako.* (I have a book.)
- *Mayroon.* (There is/are.)
:::

## Possession Sentences

Possession can be expressed using *may* or *mayroon*, or with possessive constructions.

- *May kotse si Juan.*  
  (Juan has a car.)
- *Akin ang libro.*  
  (The book is mine.)
- *Anak ni Maria ang bata.*  
  (The child is Maria's child.)

## Focus and Topic-Prominence

Tagalog is a topic-prominent language, meaning the topic (marked by *ang*, *si*, or *sina*) is central to sentence structure. The verb's focus determines which participant is marked as the topic.

### Actor Focus

- *Kumain ang bata ng mangga.*  
  (The child ate a mango.) - focus on the actor
- *Kumain si Maria ng tinapay.*  
  (Maria ate bread.) - focus on the actor

### Patient Focus

- *Kinain ng bata ang mangga.*  
  (The mango was eaten by the child.) - focus on the patient
- *Kinain ni Maria ang tinapay.*  
  (The bread was eaten by Maria.) - focus on the patient

::: info Verb Focus
The verb's affixation determines which noun phrase becomes the topic. Different verb forms highlight different participants. The topic uses *ang*/*si*/*sina*, while other participants use *ng*/*ni*/*nina* or *sa*.

## Linkers

Linkers (*na* / *-ng*) connect modifiers to nouns and create complex phrases.

| Linker Form | Usage | Example |
| ----------- | ----- | ------- |
| *na* | After vowels | *bahay na puti* (white house) |
| *-ng* | After consonants | *batang mabait* (kind child) |

Examples:

- *malaking bahay*  
  (big house)
- *magandang dalaga*  
  (beautiful lady)
- *masarap na pagkain*  
  (delicious food)

## Complex Sentences

### Coordination

Clauses can be joined with conjunctions like *at* (and), *pero* (but), *o* (or).

- *Kumain ako at natulog.*  
  (I ate and slept.)
- *Maganda siya pero masungit.*  
  (She is beautiful but grumpy.)
- *Kape o tsaa?*  
  (Coffee or tea?)

### Subordination

Subordinate clauses are introduced by conjunctions or relative pronouns.

- *Umuwi ako nang maaga kasi pagod ako.*  
  (I went home early because I was tired.)
- *Ang taong nakita ko ay guro.*  
  (The person I saw is a teacher.)

## Word Order Variations

While VSO and SVO are standard, Tagalog allows word order flexibility for emphasis.

### Emphasizing the Subject

- *Ang bata ang kumain ng mangga.*  
  (It was the child who ate the mango.)

### Emphasizing Time or Place

- *Bukas pupunta ako sa palengke.*  
  (Tomorrow I will go to the market.)
- *Sa kusina nagluto ang nanay.*  
  (In the kitchen, mother cooked.)

## Common Sentence Patterns

### Descriptive Pattern

| Pattern | Example | English |
| ------- | ------- | ------- |
| Adjective + Topic | *Maganda ang bahay.* | The house is beautiful. |
| Topic + *ay* + Adjective | *Ang bahay ay maganda.* | The house is beautiful. |

### Action Pattern

| Pattern | Example | English |
| ------- | ------- | ------- |
| Verb + Actor + Object | *Kumain ang bata ng tinapay.* | The child ate bread. |

| Verb + Patient + Actor | *Kinain ng bata ang tinapay.* | The bread was eaten by the child. |
| Patient + *ay* + Verb + Actor | *Ang tinapay ay kinain ng bata.* | The bread was eaten by the child. |

### Location Pattern

## Negation in Sentences

Negation is expressed using *hindi* (not) or *wala* (none/not exist).

- *Hindi kumain ang bata.*  
  (The child did not eat.)
- *Walang tao sa bahay.*  
  (There is no one in the house.)

## Summary

Tagalog sentence structure centers on:

1. Flexible word order (VSO or SVO)
2. Topic marking with *ang*/*si*/*sina*
3. Particles (*ng*/*ni*/*nina*, *sa*) for grammatical relationships
4. Predicate-first structure in formal speech
5. Focus system linking verb affixation to topic selection
6. *Ay* particle for topic-predicate inversion

Understanding these patterns enables learners to construct and comprehend Tagalog sentences effectively.
