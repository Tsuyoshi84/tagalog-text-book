# Verb Aspect

## Introduction

Aspect in Tagalog verbs indicates the temporal status of an action relative to its completion. Unlike English tenses that primarily mark time (past, present, future), Tagalog aspect marks whether an action is completed (perfective), ongoing (imperfective), or contemplated/future (contemplative). Aspect is expressed through reduplication, vowel changes, and affix modifications combined with focus markers.

## The Three Aspects

### Perfective (Completed Aspect)

The perfective aspect indicates that an action has been completed or reached a definitive endpoint. This aspect corresponds roughly to past tense in English, though the focus is on completion rather than time.

::: tip Marking
Completed aspect is often marked by nasal changes in prefixes (*mag-* → *nag-*, *ma-* → *na-*) and infixation of *-in-* for patient focus.
:::

Examples:
- *Kumain si Ana.*  
  (Ana ate.)
- *Nagluto si Maria ng adobo.*  
  (Maria cooked adobo.)
- *Sinulat ni Pedro ang liham.*  
  (The letter was written by Pedro.)
- *Binili niya ang libro.*  
  (He/She bought the book.)

### Imperfective (Ongoing Aspect)

The imperfective aspect indicates that an action is ongoing, habitual, or in progress. This aspect corresponds to present continuous or habitual actions in English.

::: tip Marking
Ongoing aspect is typically marked by reduplicating the first syllable of the root or modified root after the focus affix.
:::

Examples:
- *Kumakain si Ana.*  
  (Ana is eating.)
- *Nagluluto si Maria ng adobo.*  
  (Maria is cooking adobo.)
- *Sinusulat ni Pedro ang liham.*  
  (The letter is being written by Pedro.)
- *Binibili niya ang libro.*  
  (He/She is buying the book.)

### Contemplative (Future/Planned Aspect)

The contemplative aspect indicates that an action is planned, intended, or will occur in the future. This aspect corresponds to future tense or intention in English.

::: tip Marking
Contemplated aspect often uses the base form of affixes (*mag-*, *ma-*) and reduplication patterns that differ from imperfective.
:::

Examples:
- *Kakain si Ana.*  
  (Ana will eat.)
- *Magluluto si Maria ng adobo.*  
  (Maria will cook adobo.)
- *Susulatin ni Pedro ang liham.*  
  (The letter will be written by Pedro.)
- *Bibilhin niya ang libro.*  
  (He/She will buy the book.)

## Aspect Formation by Focus Type

### Actor Focus (-um-)

| Aspect | Formation | Example (Root: *kain*) | English |
|--------|-----------|----------------------|---------|
| Perfective | *-um-* infix after first consonant | *kumain* | ate |
| Imperfective | Reduplicate first CV after affix | *kumakain* | is eating |
| Contemplative | Reduplicate first CV of root | *kakain* | will eat |

Additional examples:
- Root: *sulat* (write)
  - Perfective: *sumulat* (wrote)
  - Imperfective: *sumusulat* (is writing)
  - Contemplative: *susulat* (will write)

### Actor Focus (mag-)

| Aspect | Formation | Example (Root: *luto*) | English |
|--------|-----------|----------------------|---------|
| Perfective | *nag-* prefix | *nagluto* | cooked |
| Imperfective | *nag-* + reduplicate first CV | *nagluluto* | is cooking |
| Contemplative | *mag-* + reduplicate first CV | *magluluto* | will cook |

Additional examples:
- Root: *linis* (clean)
  - Perfective: *naglinis* (cleaned)
  - Imperfective: *naglilinis* (is cleaning)
  - Contemplative: *maglilinis* (will clean)

### Patient Focus (-in)

| Aspect | Formation | Example (Root: *kain*) | English |
|--------|-----------|----------------------|---------|
| Perfective | *-in-* infix or suffix | *kinain* | was eaten |
| Imperfective | Reduplicate first CV of root | *kinakain* | is being eaten |
| Contemplative | Reduplicate first CV + *-in* suffix | *kakainin* | will be eaten |

Additional examples:
- Root: *bili* (buy)
  - Perfective: *binili* (was bought)
  - Imperfective: *binibili* (is being bought)
  - Contemplative: *bibilhin* (will be bought)

### Locative Focus (-an)

| Aspect | Formation | Example (Root: *luto*) | English |
|--------|-----------|----------------------|---------|
| Perfective | *ni-* + root + *-an* | *nilutuan* | was cooked on/at |
| Imperfective | *ni-* + reduplicate + *-an* | *nilulutuan* | is being cooked on/at |
| Contemplative | Reduplicate + *-an* | *lulutuan* | will be cooked on/at |

Additional examples:
- Root: *sulat* (write)
  - Perfective: *sinulatan* (was written on)
  - Imperfective: *sinusulatan* (is being written on)
  - Contemplative: *susulatan* (will be written on)

### Benefactive Focus (ipag-)

| Aspect | Formation | Example (Root: *luto*) | English |
|--------|-----------|----------------------|---------|
| Perfective | *ipinag-* prefix | *ipinagluto* | was cooked for |
| Imperfective | *ipinag-* + reduplicate | *ipinagluluto* | is being cooked for |
| Contemplative | *ipag-* + reduplicate | *ipagluluto* | will be cooked for |

Additional examples:
- Root: *bili* (buy)
  - Perfective: *ipinagbili* (was bought for)
  - Imperfective: *ipinagbibili* (is being bought for)
  - Contemplative: *ipagbibili* (will be bought for)

### Instrumental Focus (ipang-)

| Aspect | Formation | Example (Root: *sulat*) | English |
|--------|-----------|----------------------|---------|
| Perfective | *ipinang-* prefix | *ipinangsulat* | was used to write |
| Imperfective | *ipinang-* + reduplicate | *ipinansusulat* | is being used to write |
| Contemplative | *ipang-* + reduplicate | *ipangsusulat* | will be used to write |

Additional examples:
- Root: *hiwa* (cut)
  - Perfective: *ipinanghiwa* (was used to cut)
  - Imperfective: *ipinanhihiwa* (is being used to cut)
  - Contemplative: *ipanghihiwa* (will be used to cut)

## Reduplication Patterns

### Full Reduplication

Some verbs use full reduplication to indicate intensity, repetition, or distribution.

Examples:
- *takbo-takbo* — running around repeatedly
- *lakad-lakad* — walking around
- *kain-kain* — eating here and there

### Partial Reduplication

Most Tagalog verbs use partial reduplication, copying only the first CV (consonant-vowel) syllable.

::: info Pattern
For ongoing aspect: CV + base form after affix  
For contemplated aspect: CV + CV + base form or CV + base form depending on affix
:::

Examples with root *bili* (buy):
- *bumibili* — is buying (actor focus, ongoing)
- *bibilhin* — will buy (patient focus, contemplated)
- *binibili* — is being bought (patient focus, ongoing)

## Aspect Markers with Time Words

Aspect can be reinforced or clarified with time words, though the verb aspect remains essential.

| Time Word | Meaning | Compatible Aspects |
|-----------|---------|-------------------|
| *na* | already | Perfective |
| *pa* | still, yet | Imperfective |
| *na...na* | now, already | Imperfective, Contemplative |
| *kahapon* | yesterday | Perfective |
| *ngayon* | now, today | Imperfective |
| *bukas* | tomorrow | Contemplative |
| *mamaya* | later | Contemplative |

Examples:
- *Kumain na si Ana.*  
  (Ana already ate.)
- *Kumakain pa si Pedro.*  
  (Pedro is still eating.)
- *Kakain siya bukas.*  
  (He/She will eat tomorrow.)
- *Nagluto na ako kahapon.*  
  (I already cooked yesterday.)

## Irregular Aspect Formations

Some verbs exhibit irregular aspect patterns, particularly with vowel changes or suppletive forms.

::: details Common Irregularities
- Root: *kain* (eat)
  - Expected contemplative: *kakainin*
  - Some dialects: *kakain* (simplified)
- Root: *dating* (arrive)
  - Perfective: *dumating*
  - Contemplative: *darating* (drops *du-*)
:::

Examples:
- *Narito* (is here — stative, no clear aspect distinction)
- *Pupunta* (will go — contemplated)
- *Pumunta* (went — perfective)
- *Pumupunta* (is going — imperfective)

## Progressive and Habitual Distinctions

While the imperfective aspect covers both progressive (currently happening) and habitual (regularly happens) meanings, context usually clarifies the distinction.

Progressive examples:
- *Kumakain ako ngayon.*  
  (I am eating now.)
- *Sumusulat siya sa papel.*  
  (He/She is writing on paper.)

Habitual examples:
- *Kumakain ako ng almusal araw-araw.*  
  (I eat breakfast every day.)
- *Nagluluto siya tuwing Linggo.*  
  (He/She cooks every Sunday.)

## Aspect in Negative Constructions

Aspect marking remains when verbs are negated with *hindi* (not) or *huwag* (don't).

Examples:
- *Hindi kumain si Ana.*  
  (Ana did not eat. — perfective negated)
- *Hindi kumakain si Pedro.*  
  (Pedro is not eating. — imperfective negated)
- *Hindi kakain siya.*  
  (He/She will not eat. — contemplative negated)
- *Huwag kang kumain.*  
  (Don't eat. — imperative with contemplative base)

## Summary

Aspect is a fundamental feature of Tagalog verbs, expressed through systematic morphological changes. Understanding aspect formation enables accurate expression of temporal relationships and completion status in Tagalog.

| Aspect | Function | Typical Markers |
|--------|----------|----------------|
| Perfective | Completed action | Nasal changes (*nag-*, *na-*), *-in-* infix |
| Imperfective | Ongoing/habitual | First CV reduplication after affix |
| Contemplative | Future/planned | Base affix with reduplication patterns |
