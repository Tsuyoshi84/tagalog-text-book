# Tagalog Verb Focus System

## Overview

The Tagalog focus system marks which participant of the clause is highlighted (topic) while expressing semantic roles. Focus is mainly shown through verb affixes. Selecting a focus changes which noun phrase is emphasized and adjusts particles (*ang*, *si*, *ng*, *sa*). Roles (actor, patient, location, beneficiary, instrument, goal) remain; the chosen affix promotes one role to topical subject.

## Core Focus Types

### Actor Focus (AF)

Emphasizes the performer. Common affixes: *-um-*, *mag-*, *ma-*, *mang-*.

Example:

- *Kumain si Jose ng mangga.*  
  (Jose ate a mango.)
- *Magsusulat si Ana ng liham.*  
  (Ana will write a letter.)
- *Maglilinis ang bata ng kwarto.*  
  (The child will clean a room.)

### Object / Patient Focus (PF)

Emphasizes the affected entity. Common affixes: *-in-*, *i-*, *-an* (patient variant with certain roots), *ipa-* (causative when object is caused).

Example:

- *Kinain ni Jose ang mangga.*  
  (The mango was eaten by Jose.)
- *Isusulat ni Ana ang liham.*  
  (The letter will be written by Ana.)
- *Lilinisín ng bata ang kwarto.*  
  (The room will be cleaned by the child.)

### Locative Focus (LF)

Emphasizes place or spatial target. Common affixes: *-an*, *pag- -an*, *i- + -an*.

Example:

- *Pinaglutuan ni Maria ang kalan.*  
  (The stove was where Maria cooked.)
- *Susulatan ni Ana ang sobre.*  
  (The envelope will be written on by Ana.)
- *Paglilinisán ng bata ang kwarto.*  
  (The room will be the place cleaned by the child.)

### Benefactive Focus (BF)

Emphasizes beneficiary or recipient. Common affixes: *ipag-*, *pag- -an*, *i-*.

Example:

- *Ipagluluto ni Maria ang anak.*  
  (The child will be cooked for by Maria.)
- *Ipagsusulat ni Ana ang kaibigan ng liham.*  
  (The friend will be written a letter by Ana.)
- *Ipinaglinis ng guro ang estudyante ng silid.*  
  (The student cleaned the room for the teacher.)

### Instrumental Focus (IF)

Emphasizes tool or means. Common affixes: *ipang-*, *pang-*, *maipang-*.

Example:

- *Ipinangsulat ni Ana ang pluma.*  
  (The pen was what Ana used to write.)
- *Ipinangkain ni Jose ang kutsara.*  
  (The spoon was what Jose used to eat.)
- *Ipinanglinis ng bata ang walis.*  
  (The broom was what the child used to clean.)

### Directional / Goal Focus (GF)

Emphasizes destination or endpoint. Common affixes: *i-*, *ipag-*, *-an* with motion roots.

Example:

- *Dadalhan ni Maria ang tindahan ng gulay.*  
  (The store will be brought vegetables by Maria.)
- *Ihahatid ni Jose ang bata sa paaralan.*  
  (The child will be brought to the school by Jose.)
- *Pagdadalan ni Ana ang kaibigan ng sulat.*  
  (The friend will be the one letters are brought to by Ana.)

## Sentence Pattern Examples (*sulat* root)

| Focus | Form | Example | English |
|-------|------|---------|---------|
| Actor | *sumulat* | *Sumulat si Pedro ng liham.* | Pedro wrote a letter. |
| Patient | *sinulat* | *Sinulat ni Pedro ang liham.* | The letter was written by Pedro. |
| Benefactive | *isinulat* | *Isinulat ni Pedro ang liham para sa kaibigan.* | The letter was written by Pedro for a friend. |
| Instrumental | *ipinangsulat* | *Ipinangsulat ni Pedro ang lapis.* | The pencil was what Pedro used to write. |

## Focus Selection Guidelines

1. The discourse topic is identified.  
2. One focus affix is chosen.  
3. Affix precedes aspect morphology.  
4. Topic uses *ang* / *si*. Others use *ng* or *sa*.  
5. Patient focus is favored when affected entity is central.

## Common Pitfalls

- Overuse of actor focus when patient emphasis is intended.  
- Mixing *-um-* and *-in-* in one form.  
- Assuming *-an* is always locative.  
- Omitting *ni* with patient focus.  
- Instrument focus without instrument noun.

## Practice Sentences

Identify focus type:

- *Binili ni Carla ang aklat.*  (The book was bought by Carla.)
- *Bumili si Carla ng aklat.*  (Carla bought a book.)
- *Bibilhan ni Carla ang kapatid ng aklat.*  (The sibling will be bought a book by Carla.)
- *Binilhan ni Carla ang tindahan ng aklat.*  (The store was where Carla bought a book.)
- *Ipinambili ni Carla ang pera ng aklat.*  (The money was what Carla used to buy a book.)

Answers: patient, actor, benefactive, locative, instrumental.
