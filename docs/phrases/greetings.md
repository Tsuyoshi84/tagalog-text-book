::: tip Cultural Note
Adding *po* and *ho* shows respect and is expected when speaking to elders, authority figures, or strangers. Omitting these particles when appropriate can be considered rude.[^po]
:::

[^po]: The particle *po* is more formal than *ho*, though both indicate respect. *Po* is preferred in most situations.
