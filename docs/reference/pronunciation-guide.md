# Pronunciation Guide

## Introduction

Tagalog pronunciation is relatively straightforward for English speakers. The language uses the Latin alphabet with consistent sound-to-letter correspondence. This guide covers vowel sounds, consonants, stress patterns, and common pronunciation challenges.

## Vowels

Tagalog has five vowel phonemes with consistent pronunciation.

### Basic Vowels

| Letter | IPA | English Approximation | Tagalog Example | Pronunciation |
|--------|-----|---------------------|-----------------|---------------|
| a | /a/ | Similar to "a" in "father" | *araw* | ah-raw |
| e | /ɛ/ | Similar to "e" in "met" | *mesa* | meh-sah |
| i | /i/ | Similar to "ee" in "meet" | *isda* | ees-dah |
| o | /o/ | Similar to "o" in "go" | *oso* | oh-soh |
| u | /u/ | Similar to "oo" in "food" | *ulan* | oo-lahn |

::: tip Consistency
Tagalog vowels maintain their sounds regardless of position in a word, unlike English vowels.
:::

### Vowel Length

Vowel length is not phonemic in Tagalog. All vowels are pronounced with roughly equal length unless emphasized for clarity or emotion.

Examples:
- *bata* (child) – BAH-tah
- *mata* (eye) – MAH-tah
- *damit* (clothing) – dah-MEET

## Consonants

Most Tagalog consonants sound similar to their English counterparts.

### Standard Consonants

| Letter | IPA | English Equivalent | Tagalog Example | Pronunciation |
|--------|-----|-------------------|-----------------|---------------|
| b | /b/ | "b" in "boy" | *bata* | bah-TAH |
| k | /k/ | "k" in "kite" | *kain* | kah-IN |
| d | /d/ | "d" in "dog" | *damit* | dah-MEET |
| g | /g/ | "g" in "go" (always hard) | *gabi* | gah-BEE |
| h | /h/ | "h" in "hat" (softer) | *bahay* | bah-HIGH |
| l | /l/ | "l" in "love" | *luto* | loo-TOH |
| m | /m/ | "m" in "mother" | *mata* | mah-TAH |
| n | /n/ | "n" in "no" | *naman* | nah-MAHN |
| p | /p/ | "p" in "pen" | *puno* | poo-NOH |
| r | /ɾ/ | Flapped "r" (Spanish-style) | *araw* | ah-RAW |
| s | /s/ | "s" in "sun" | *saya* | sah-YAH |
| t | /t/ | "t" in "top" | *tayo* | tah-YOH |
| w | /w/ | "w" in "water" | *wala* | wah-LAH |
| y | /j/ | "y" in "yes" | *yaman* | yah-MAHN |

::: info Letter G
The letter "g" is always hard in Tagalog (as in "go"), never soft (as in "gem").
:::

### Special Consonants

#### ng /ŋ/

The digraph *ng* represents a single sound, similar to the ending of "sing" in English.

| Word | Pronunciation | English |
|------|---------------|---------|
| *ngayon* | ngah-YOHN | now |
| *ngiti* | ngee-TEE | smile |
| *pang-ilan* | pahng-ee-LAHN | what number |
| *sang-ayon* | sahng-ah-YOHN | agree |

::: warning Common Mistake
Do not pronounce *ng* as "n" + "g" separately. It is a single nasal sound.
:::

Practice words:
- *nganga* (with mouth open) – ngah-NGAH
- *ngunit* (but) – ngoo-NEET
- *tanong* (question) – tah-NOHNG

#### glottal stop (')

The glottal stop is not written in standard Tagalog orthography but is an important phonemic distinction. It represents a brief pause or catch in the throat.

| Without Glottal Stop | With Glottal Stop | Meaning Difference |
|---------------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| *bata* /bata/ | *bata'* /bataʔ/ | child vs. bathrobe |
| *aso* /aso/ | *aso'* /asoʔ/ | dog vs. smoke |
| *puno* /puno/ | *puno'* /punoʔ/ | tree vs. full |

::: details Linguistic Note
The glottal stop (/ʔ/) occurs between repeated vowels or at the end of words ending in vowels in certain contexts.
:::

## Stress Patterns

Stress placement affects meaning in Tagalog. Incorrect stress can change a word's meaning or make it incomprehensible.

### Stress Rules

#### Penultimate Stress (Default)

Most Tagalog words are stressed on the second-to-last syllable (penultimate).

| Word | Stressed Syllable | Pronunciation | English |
|------|------------------|---------------|---------|
| *bata* | ba-**TA** | bah-TAH | child |
| *bahay* | ba-**HAY** | bah-HIGH | house |
| *kumain* | ku-**MA**-in | koo-MAH-in | ate |
| *maganda* | ma-gan-**DA** | mah-gahn-DAH | beautiful |

#### Ultimate Stress (Final Syllable)

Some words stress the final syllable. These are often marked with an acute accent in teaching materials (á, é, í, ó, ú).

| Word | Stressed Syllable | Pronunciation | English |
|------|------------------|---------------|---------|
| *tahanan* | ta-ha-**NAN** | tah-hah-NAHN | home |
| *bilisan* | bi-li-**SAN** | bee-lee-SAHN | hurry up |
| *mahal* | ma-**HAL** | mah-HAHL | expensive/love |
| *sapatos* | sa-pa-**TOS** | sah-pah-TOHS | shoes |

#### Antepenultimate Stress (Rare)

Very few words stress the third-from-last syllable.

| Word | Stressed Syllable | Pronunciation | English |
|------|------------------|---------------|---------|
| *talumpati* | ta-**LUM**-pa-ti | tah-LOOM-pah-tee | speech |

### Minimal Pairs (Stress-Dependent Meaning)

| Penultimate Stress | Ultimate Stress | Meaning Difference |
|-------------------|----------------|-------------------|
| *ba**TA*** (child) | *ba**TAʔ*** (bathrobe) | child vs. bathrobe |
| *sa**LA*** (living room) | *sa**LAʔ*** (sin) | living room vs. sin |
| *ba**SA*** (read) | *ba**SAʔ*** (wet) | read vs. wet |

::: tip Learning Strategy
Pay attention to how native speakers stress words. When learning new vocabulary, note the stress pattern along with the meaning.
:::

## Diphthongs

Tagalog has several diphthongs (combinations of two vowel sounds in one syllable).

| Diphthong | Example | Pronunciation | English |
|-----------|---------|---------------|---------|
| /aj/ | *bahay* | bah-HIGH | house |
| /aw/ | *araw* | ah-RAW | day/sun |
| /oj/ | *bahaghari* contains /oj/ | bah-hahg-hah-REE | rainbow |
| /iw/ | *aliw* | ah-LEEW | entertainment |

## Syllable Structure

Tagalog syllables follow relatively simple patterns.

### Common Patterns

| Pattern | Example | Breakdown | English |
|---------|---------|-----------|---------|
| V | *a-raw* | a-raw | day/sun |
| CV | *ba-hay* | ba-hay | house |
| VC | *is-da* | is-da | fish |
| CVC | *kan-in* | ka-nin | rice |
| CCV | *pru-tas* | pru-tas | fruit |

::: info Consonant Clusters
Consonant clusters are mostly found in Spanish loanwords: *pl* (plato), *pr* (prutas), *tr* (trabaho), *dr* (drama), *kl* (klase), *kr* (krus), *bl* (blusa), *br* (braso).
:::

## Spanish Influence on Pronunciation

Many Tagalog words are borrowed from Spanish. These words often retain Spanish pronunciation patterns.

### Examples

| Tagalog (Spanish origin) | Spanish | English | Pronunciation Note |
|-------------------------|---------|---------|-------------------|
| *mesa* | mesa | table | MEH-sah |
| *silya* | silla | chair | SIL-yah |
| *libro* | libro | book | LEE-broh |
| *karne* | carne | meat | kar-NEH |
| *estudyante* | estudiante | student | es-tood-YAHN-teh |
| *numeró* | número | number | noo-meh-ROH |

::: warning "J" and "F" Sounds
Tagalog does not have native "j" (/dʒ/) or "f" (/f/) sounds. In Spanish loanwords, "j" becomes "h" and "f" becomes "p":
- *jabón* → *habon* (soap)
- *fuerte* → *pwersa* (force)
:::

## Common Pronunciation Challenges

### For English Speakers

| Challenge | Explanation | Practice |
|-----------|-------------|----------|
| Vowel consistency | English vowels shift; Tagalog vowels stay constant | *bata* always "BAH-tah", never "BAY-tah" |
| The *ng* sound | Not "n" + "g" but a single nasal | *ngayon*, *tanghalì*, *sanga* |
| Flapped /r/ | Tongue taps once behind teeth | *araw*, *pero*, *oras* |
| Final consonants | Pronounce final consonants clearly | *kumain* (koo-mah-IN, not koo-mah-EEN) |
| Stress placement | Incorrect stress changes meaning | *baSA* (wet) vs. *BAsa* (read) |

### Practice Sentences

| Tagalog | Pronunciation Guide | English |
|---------|-------------------|---------|
| *Kumain ako ng kanin.* | koo-mah-IN ah-KOH nang kah-NIN | I ate rice. |
| *Ang ganda ng bulaklak.* | ahng gahn-DAH nang boo-lahk-LAHK | The flower is beautiful. |
| *Saan ka pupunta ngayon?* | sah-AHN kah poo-poon-TAH ngah-YOHN | Where are you going now? |
| *Mahal kita.* | mah-HAHL kee-TAH | I love you. |
| *Salamat po.* | sah-lah-MAHT poh | Thank you. |

## Regional Variations

Tagalog pronunciation varies across regions of the Philippines.

### Common Variations

| Feature | Manila/Standard | Regional Variation | Example |
|---------|----------------|-------------------|---------|
| /e/ and /i/ | Distinct | Often merged to /i/ | *mesa* → *misa* |
| /o/ and /u/ | Distinct | Often merged to /u/ | *aso* → *asu* |
| Glottal stop | Pronounced | Sometimes dropped | *puno'* → *puno* |
| /d/ | Standard | Sometimes /r/ | *daan* → *raan* |

::: info Standard Tagalog
Standard Tagalog (based on Manila dialect) distinguishes /e/ from /i/ and /o/ from /u/. This is the pronunciation taught in schools and used in media.
:::

## Intonation

### Statement Intonation

Statements typically have falling intonation at the end.

- *Kumain ako.* ↘ (I ate.)
- *Maganda ang araw.* ↘ (The day is beautiful.)

### Question Intonation

Yes/no questions have rising intonation.

- *Kumain ka na?* ↗ (Have you eaten?)
- *Pupunta ka ba?* ↗ (Are you going?)

Information questions (with question words) have falling intonation.

- *Saan ka pupunta?* ↘ (Where are you going?)
- *Ano ang ginawa mo?* ↘ (What did you do?)
